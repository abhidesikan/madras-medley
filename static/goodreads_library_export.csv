While the Arthashastra is primarily known as a treatise on statecraft, politics, and military strategy, the author explores the economic policies and vision prescribed by Chanakya in the text and draws parallels with Bharat in the 21st century, highlighting the lessons we can learn from Kautilya.<br/><br/>The author first explores the depth of research and the level of understanding of Sanskrit, as well as Bharatiya culture, that are required as prerequisites to begin understanding the foundations of this treatise.<br/><br/>After a brief overview of the Arthashastra, he focuses on the foundations of economic policy as laid down by Chanakya. The fundamental worldview of Kautilya’s economic thought is rooted in Dharma. Dharma forms the basis for creating a sustainable society built on ethics, responsibilities, and social harmony.<br/><br/>He then explores different aspects of policymaking and modern-day economic functions such as trade, sustainability, the environment, growth, debt, wealth creation, gold, and manufacturing. The author also examines the unique nature of India as a civilization—our propensity to save gold as a hedge and hereditary treasure, the practice of community-based loans instead of traditional lending systems, and the way kings functioned as servants of the people rather than as authoritarian rulers.<br/><br/>He further attempts to extrapolate how Kautilya might have dealt with uncertainties such as the COVID pandemic and the lessons we can draw from such an approach.<br/><br/>Overall, the book serves as a good introduction to the Arthashastra from an economic perspective and piques the reader’s interest to explore the text in greater depth.",,,1,0

232337729,Our Living Constitution : A Concise Introduction & Commentary,Shashi Tharoor,"Tharoor, Shashi",,"=""9365235308""","=""9789365235302""",3,3.71,Aleph Book Company,Kindle Edition,,2025,,2025/10/14,2025/06/27,,,read,"Our Living Constitution by Dr. Shashi Tharoor is meant to be a concise introduction to the Indian Constitution and a primer on the duties and rights of Indian citizens. While the book begins with this premise, it quickly turns into a subtle—but not so subtle—critique of the present BJP government led by Modi and offers little in terms of a balanced perspective, something unexpected from a person of Dr. Tharoor’s caliber.<br/><br/>Dr. Tharoor walks us through the climate in which the Constitution was framed, the different arguments put forth by various members of the Constituent Assembly, and how the vision for India was deliberated. The overarching theme—and intent—of the nation’s founding fathers was to build an inclusive India that grants rights to every individual citizen regardless of birth, race, caste, religion, or other identifying factors. Most notably, he highlights how India chose a different path from Pakistan and was intentional in not becoming a Hindu majoritarian state, but one where people of all religions could claim first rights to being “Indian.”<br/><br/>Dr. Tharoor then presents the dissenters of the Constitution—figures like Veer Savarkar, M.S. Golwalkar, and Deen Dayal Upadhyaya—who had an alternative idea of India as a Hindu Rashtra and wanted a Constitution that reflected the soul of the nation. This India, they argued, would embrace people of all religions as long as they subscribed to the national cultural mainstream and revered its heroes. They strongly rejected the anglicized and westernized Constitution that was being formulated.<br/><br/>He then tries—unsuccessfully, I might add—to connect the ideals of Deen Dayal Upadhyaya with those of present-day BJP leaders. He argues that despite their obeisance to the Constitution, they are only paying lip service while fundamentally changing the freedoms and rights enshrined in it, reverting to a majoritarian state. However, the arguments he puts forth to support this narrative come across as weak, inconsistent, and at times not fact-based. For example, his comparison of the “suspension of rights” during the Emergency and during the COVID-19 lockdown—equating these two vastly different circumstances as proof of authoritarianism in the present government—seems laughable. Likewise, he argues for equality before law for all citizens and vehemently criticizes the CAA, calling it the first law to violate the fundamental principles of the Constitution by using religion as a basis for discrimination against Muslims. Yet, he sidesteps the same principle when it comes to the UCC, echoing the classic leftist view that minority rights and practices must be protected to maintain pluralism and diversity.<br/><br/>While Dr. Tharoor’s heart is in the right place, and his appeal to the youth of the country to be aware of their rights and duties and strengthen India’s democracy is commendable, I believe this book leaves much to be desired. It falls just one step short of being a full-blown propagandist agenda.",,,1,0

As someone who’s long been interested in the origins of humanity, the movement of people and languages, and the ancient DNA revolution, I was excited to understand it all in greater detail straight from the horse's mouth.<br/><br/>This book is a fascinating introduction to the world of ancient DNA and how it has fundamentally reshaped not just genetics but also other scientific fields, from archaeology and biology to medicine and economics. It challenges long-held beliefs and breaks stereotypes about human evolution.<br/><br/>David Reich offers a sweeping walkthrough of ancient DNA research (as of 2018), showing how studying entire genomes, not just chromosomes, has helped trace the journey of our species from its roots in Africa to its spread across Europe and beyond.<br/><br/>There’s a wealth of information in this book (which I won’t fully dive into here) about the DNA sequencing process, from sample collection and four-population tests to identifying ghost populations. He explains how sequence lengths, mutation rates, and genome density help reveal deep ancestral patterns across human populations.<br/><br/>One of the book’s central themes is that there are no “pure” human lineages. Humans, Neanderthals, and Denisovans have repeatedly intermixed over tens of thousands of years. Reich also addresses how misinterpretations of genetics, like those seen in Nazi Germany, have had harmful political consequences and how today’s researchers must carefully navigate these challenges while pursuing the truth.<br/><br/>The chapters I found most compelling were the ones on the making of modern Europe and, naturally, the one on India — two stories that are deeply intertwined and have sparked debate for decades. Reich traces the narrative from the Rig Veda to the tribes of North Sentinel Island. His collaboration with the Indian government to collect a vast array of DNA samples was fascinating to read.<br/><br/>He also explains how he had to carefully frame his findings about a major West Eurasian migration into India, given the politically sensitive nature of the Aryan Invasion Theory (AIT). This led him to introduce the terms Ancestral North Indians (ANI) and Ancestral South Indians (ASI), two genetically distinct populations that fully mixed over time to form the ancestry of modern Indians (excluding groups like those on North Sentinel Island). The ANI are genetically linked to Europeans, while the ASI descended from a group not related to any population outside India. Their eventual mixing, which occurred between 4,000 and 2,000 years ago, was followed by the rise of caste-based endogamy, isolating population groups for centuries, a phenomenon known as a “population bottleneck.”<br/><br/>India, despite having over a billion people, isn't one large genetic population like the Han Chinese. Instead, thanks to jati endogamy, it is a mosaic of many small, distinct groups.<br/><br/>Reich extends his exploration to other continents, shedding light on their unique ancestral histories and revealing the untapped potential of ancient DNA as more global data becomes available. His ability to make such a complex, nuanced subject accessible is a testament to both his clear writing and deep dedication.<br/><br/>By the end of the book, it's hard not to feel a sense of awe and curiosity about how many more myths and revelations are still waiting to be uncovered. The story of humanity, it seems, is far from over.",,,1,0

Ltd.,Kindle Edition,274,2020,2019,2025/01/06,2024/12/05,,,read,"The Sangh and Swaraj is a short book on the role of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) in India's freedom struggle. It is authored by Ratan Sharda, a longtime RSS activist who has also written other books on RSS and demystified it for the general public. This book, in particular, shares documentary and anecdotal evidence of RSS's role in the freedom movement, which has often been questioned in Indian mainstream media and used as a brickbat against the Sangh. It is tragic that a selfless volunteer organization like RSS, which has always put the nation first and hasn't sought publicity for its contributions, has to prove itself. On the other hand, the necessity to set the record straight has brought out the need for this and other books, thus enhancing the literature on the subject. <br/><br/>The book briefly introduces the founder of RSS, Dr.Hedgewar (also known as Doctorji), his time with Congress, the founding of RSS with the goal of national freedom and youth to serve the nation, and its subsequent expansion. We also read about Shri Golwalkar (also known as Guruji), who took the mantle after Hedgewar's passing and was key to expanding the base of RSS throughout the country and making it one of the most critical organizations in the country. <br/><br/>Both leaders took various initiatives during the freedom struggle movements, such as non-cooperation and Quit India. Furthermore, Sangh volunteers actively participated in the freedom struggle, with many losing their lives. At the time of independence and partition, Guruji and the Sangh were at the forefront of the crisis, being involved in relief and rehabilitation work for the countless people whose lives were uprooted. They also did exemplary work in protecting women and children from atrocities by setting up various relief camps.<br/><br/>Lastly, the author sheds light on the RSS's growing popularity and the resentment it caused the Congress. The Congress tried various ways to stifle the organization's growth despite stating many times that it did not have any political goals and was only focused on national service. After the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi, a ban was placed on RSS despite them strongly condemning the incident and having a nationwide mourning. Eventually, though the ban was lifted, it showed the vile machinations of the Congress of the time, and the consequences of those actions continue to tarnish the RSS's image today. <br/><br/>It can be said without ambiguity that RSS played a vital role in the Indian freedom struggle, without which one cannot imagine the level of damage that could have been caused. The organization continues to be the backbone of India in times of crisis and should be celebrated and acknowledged for its contributions. ",,,1,0

It can also be considered a geopolitical history book that outlines our journey since independence and the vicissitudes we’ve seen with our foreign affairs. The book also establishes the vision and focus for the future and charts the path ahead. Hence, it can be seen as a foundational book for a rising India. All of this is stitched into a cohesive and engaging read by drawing historical parallels with the Ramayana, narrated by the sitting Minister of External Affairs of India, Dr.S Jaishankar, making this a very engaging read for people who believe in the India story. <br/><br/>What sets this book apart is its ability to help the reader understand the nature and scope of external affairs and the scale at which the “mind games” happen. No country is too small, and no negotiation is straightforward. From the USA to China, bilateral relations to QUAD, influencing nations with soft and hard power like Vaccine Maitri, etc., Jaishankar paints the world and India’s role with a broad brush. He gives a sense of the complexities and challenges involved. <br/><br/>It was enlightening to read about the sharpness and clarity with which each relationship is analyzed, its historical precedent, and the thinking behind decision-making. Decades of efforts to build a relationship can turn sour instantly, as seen when China clashed with India at Galwan. The opposite is true as well, where relatively sparse exchanges with countries rapidly advanced after renewing contact for each other’s benefit, as is the case with Australia. <br/><br/>What shines through all of this is that the India pre-2014 and post-2014 under the Modi leadership are distinct from each other in many ways, and significant progress has been achieved in the last ten years than, one could argue, has been made in all of the post-independence years combined before that. And we must give credit where it’s due. It is indeed heartening and encouraging to see India in safe hands and ready to take on the leadership of the global south and put its own interests first while balancing it worth the needs of its neighbors and the world at large. ",,,1,0

I picked this one up as my manager recommended it and finally read it. The New One Minute Manager, as the name suggests, is a short guidebook to managers on how they can manage people and help them and the organization grow together. While the original One Minute Manager came a couple of decades ago, this book has been adapted to today's more flat organizational style compared to the top-down hierarchical structures businesses followed in previous decades.<br/><br/>Instead of being a preachy and direct rulebook of what one should or shouldn't do, this book takes a conversational route, with the protagonist being a young man joining a new organization who's eager to meet the ""New One Minute Manager"" and learn why he's so good and well respected by his organization as well as his colleagues. The book walks us through three ""secrets"" to effective management - One Minute Goals, One Minute Praises, and One Minute Re-Directs. Each of these takes, as you guessed it, just a minute to act on but significantly affects the well-being, productivity, and growth of the individuals and the organization as a whole.<br/><br/>As someone who has transitioned into a managerial role for close to a year now, I felt encouraged that I was already practicing some of the tips mentioned in the book. I found other perspectives helpful while also feeling skeptical of whether some things would work. There are enough resources and people with experience on the internet and in organizations today who can provide much better mentoring on being an effective manager. Still, it works as an introductory book for someone starting out and needing guidance.",,,1,0

Muslim Separatism: Causes and Consequences is no exception. <br/><br/>This is a review of the seminal book, 'The Tragic Story of Partition' by H.V. Seshadri. SRG, while broadly agreeing with the clarity and retelling of H.V. Seshadri, adds his own opinions where he differs from the author. The book delves into the causes that led to the partition of India and how the Hindu society and the leaders of the Indian National Congress failed and continue to fail to understand the consciousness of Islam and the sinister nature of the 'residues of Islamic imperialism' - the people and movement that emerged post the downfall of the Mughal empire. <br/><br/>SRG is a master at both rising up the patriot within us while making us hang our heads in shame when we realize how the misjudgments and lack of insight into the mind of the enemy led to the bloody massacre of an ancient civilization and its people. He provides a continuity of the stream of thought among Muslims right from the fall of the Mughal empire to reclaim India as a whole and places all of their actions before and during the freedom struggle in that context. From the Wahabbi movement inspired by Shah Waliullah, followed by Ahmad Shah Abdali, Abdul Aziz, Syed Ahmed Barelvi, Titu, and Dudhu Mian, to finally the father of the two-nation theory, Sir Syed Ahmed Khan, SRG traces the underlying motive and cause of jihad until partition. He laments how the national leadership under the Indian National Congress failed to have any sense of historical perspective and thus kept losing ground to the Muslims as they sided for and against the British at their convenience. <br/><br/>It is important to note that SRG gives credit where due, primarily to the British for their meticulous study of Indian history, geology, and scriptures and rigorously documenting them to lead us to write our history in a more modern and ordered manner. He praises the shining beacons of our national resurgence, starting with Maharishi Dayananda Saraswati, Bankim Chandra Chatterjee, Swami Vivekananda, and Sri Aurobindo. It is unfortunate that despite such stalwarts trying to shake us from our slumber and open our eyes to the greatness of our spiritual and cultural heritage, the leaders of the Indian National Congress were blinded by the promises and ideologies purported by the British and the Muslim league. <br/><br/>One might wonder what the purpose of reading such books might be today, but cliched as it might sound, history does repeat itself. There are many lessons to be learned from India's history, particularly around the independence movement and the partition. For India to progress as a nation and re-assert its civilizational strength and culture, it must learn from the mistakes it made in its past to rise to a confident future.",,,1,0

We spend some time in Thanjai, where we witness a battle of words and wits between the Ilaya Piratti Kundhavai and Pazhuvoor Rani Nandini, but most of the story is set in Sri Lanka. As the story progresses, we see Vandhiyathevan eventually establishing contact with Kundhavai, who assigns him the new task of bringing back her younger brother, Arunmozhi Varman, from Ilankai. His elder brother, Aditya Karikalan, also does the same, sending Parthibendran Pallavan with his message. <br/><br/>The book follows a similar theme to Book 1, filled with adventure, fights, escapes, and mysteries. After a long wait, we meet the book's central character, Prince Arunmozhi Varman, a.k.a Ponniyin Selvan, as Vanthiyathevan and Azhwarkkadiyan find him in Sri Lanka. Kalki describes the islands, the flora, and the fauna exquisitely, and also the prevailing Buddhist influences there. He also elaborately details the character of Ponniyin Selvan as a humble, just, and empathetic ruler and draws a sharp contrast with his elder and rash brother Aditya Karikalan. Ponniyin Selvan respects all religions and Gods, goes to any lengths for his people and friends, never goes against his king's (and father's) wishes, and treats everyone with empathy and kindness. So good was he that the residents of Ilankai went about their business and worshipped him wherever he went, despite the Chozas warring against King Mahindan. <br/><br/>We are also introduced to a few key characters, most notably Mandakini, a.k.a Oomai Rani, who acts as the guardian angel of our hero, saving him from drowning as a kid as well as various attempts by the Pandyan rebels to kill him in Sri Lanka. Moreover, she arrives with food and an Arab horse and guides the Prince during crucial times, sharing vital information. We also get to know Poonguzhali, the boat woman with such deep affection for the Prince and who journeys with him as he tries to honor his father's commands and be imprisoned by troops coming from Thanjai. And lastly, Kodumbalur Periya Velar Senathipathi Boothi Vikramakesari,  who bristles at the mention of Pazhuvettaraiyars and vows to go to any lengths to protect the king. <br/><br/>Kalki portrays Arunmozhi Varman as someone who thinks of himself almost as a victim of circumstance, as he laments his fate of not having anyone who wants to know what his inner desires are - to travel and explore the world through the seas. In contrast, everyone wants to burden him with one title or the other and rule the Chola Kingdom. He emphasizes the enormous challenge of leading such a vast country and is glad there are others before him. It is interesting to imagine that the great Raja Raja Chozan would have felt this way, and moments like these make this book a masterpiece. <br/><br/>The exchanges between Vanthiyathevan, the Prince, and Azhwarkaddiyan are timely and hilarious and make one wonder how much better it would have been in Tamil. The book ends on a cliffhanger, with Vandhiyathevan caught in the middle of a storm as the magician Ravidasan and Devaralan abandon him on board after he refuses to join their mission of destroying the Cholas. Our Prince braves it all to save him in the nick of time. Onwards to part 3! ",,,1,0

At the outset, the book aims to provide a thesis/postulation to try and reconcile one of the most intriguing mysteries of proto-Indian history - who the Vedic people were and how they were related to the Harappan civilization. Were they the same or two entities that existed in different periods?<br/><br/>To solve this riddle, the author references the Puranic king lists published by Britishman F.E Pargiter in 1922, after years of meticulous research to try and bring out the historicity of Indian tradition based on the Itihasa-Puranas. Most of the book is spent postulating how, by comparing different periods of ancient Indian civilization with the corresponding kings, their histories, and the archaeological, geographical, and other recent scientific evidence, we can understand that the Vedic people and the Harappans were the same and part of the same milieu. <br/><br/>The author provides a lot of maps and other tabular data to put forth his arguments. Key among them are the timelines for the Ramayana matching with the mature Harappan phase between 2600-2000BCE, which signaled growth and prosperity, the start of the Dvapara Yuga coinciding with the late Harappan phase and the end of the Mahabharata war culminating with the dark post-Harappan phase that existed between 1400-600 BCE. There are also calculations based on backtracking the king lists with average life spans from the Mauryan period to Manu himself.<br/><br/>We dive deep into civilizations East and West, the interactions between them and the Harappans, conceptualizing Asuras and Devas w.r.t to immigrants from outside vs. within. The author also speculated on the original location of Ayodhya to be Harappa itself and how the Ramayana took place within the Harappan locations and later included all of Bharatavarsha. While some of his correlations warrant deeper investigation, others do not conform with existing discoveries. <br/><br/>The book also examines the Aryan invasion theory related to these timelines, genetics, linguistics, the spread of languages, and the split between Indo-Aryan and Elamo-Dravidian languages. <br/><br/>It took a lot of work to follow some parts of the book, particularly the explanations of Asuras and Devas, following lineages of the Iksvaku clan, etc. The author tries to focus on too many disciplines and could have made the explanations more lucid. Still, it was an academic and engaging read.",,,1,0

As the title suggests, this book is both an introduction and a dive deep into the world of mutual funds in India. It provides a step-by-step guide for investors on investing in mutual funds at any stage of their life or financial journey. <br/><br/>There are a lot of similarities to its predecessor - easy-to-understand language, relatable examples, gotchas and lessons to learn, and the caring and considerate manner in which she disambiguates the complexities in mutual funds. There are also some differences; mutual funds are essentially a subset (albeit hard to understand) of your finances overall, and the jargon takes some getting used to. There are also hundreds of options, asset classes, funds, schemes, and so on that, despite the simplification, require double reading occasionally. <br/><br/>What one takes away from this book is that mutual funds are a fantastic instrument to grow one’s wealth, but understanding how they work, what purpose they need to serve, and planning them based on our needs are what actually provide value. Monika spends enough time covering the basics and ensuring we understand it before eventually providing us with a framework for investing and making the right choice. This book isn’t a get-rich-tomorrow book; it’s a get-rich eventually-by-making sound choices book. <br/><br/>There is still a lot of hard work left for the reader to go ahead and implement the suggestions provided by the author, but where the book shines is in helping us, the investor, be confident in our choices and make the right short and long-term decisions. <br/><br/>As someone who isn’t very financially literate, I found this an eye-opener, and I highly recommend it for youngsters starting their career and investment journey.",,,1,0

Strangely, these are the only emotions one experiences while reading Dr. Anand Ranganathan's latest book - Hindus in Hindu Rashtra: Eighth-Class Citizens and Victims of state-sanctioned apartheid.<br/><br/>If the title of this book isn't sobering enough for a practicing Hindu, reading through it only makes it worse with every turn of the page. In his characteristic style, self-proclaimed ""Darwinian-Atheist"" Dr. Anand makes a searing indictment of the judiciary, legislature, and the Indian state itself as he rips apart the ""secular fabric"" narrative peddled in our country and lays bare harsh truths and the reality of the pathetic nature of existence of Hindus in India, mockingly asking us after every chapter - Is this what you call a Hindu Rashtra? <br/><br/>The book is short and delivers knockout punch after punch, from the State control of temples, ethnic cleansing of Kashmiri Hindus, The Waqf Act, The RTE Act, the hypocrisy of the judiciary in reforming only Hinduism and appeasing non-Hindus, the Places of Worship Act, and the ultimate debasement of Hindus by continually extolling mass murderers and converters whose atrocious acts continue to live in collective memory to this day. Despite all this, we still patiently went the judicial route, not the anarchic way to reclaim the Ram Janmabhumi, a mere 500-year wait to heal our civilizational trauma. <br/><br/>As Anand rightly mentions, most Hindus of India aren't even aware of how they're subject to legal and constitutional subjugation. That an atheist has done a fantastic job elucidating the plight of Hindus in this country makes one hang their head in shame. <br/><br/>This book is an eye-opener and a must-read. Our ancestors fought for millennia to keep Hinduism alive, which is being eradicated in independent India under our noses. Wake up, ye Hindus, from your slumber before it is too late. <br/><br/>",,,1,0

The book details the entire history of the place, the continued worship and faith of millions at the site, and the various conflicts due to the construction of the Babri Masjid by Babur and its subsequent demolition.<br/><br/>As always, Meenakshi Jain's book is highly academic, with many primary source reference materials. Page by page, she lays out the history of Rama at Ayodhya, records from Babur and other foreign travelers on the continued worship and the destruction of the Mandir, the resistance from the Muslim side, the subsequent filing of cases under the British Raj, the archaeological excavations conducted by ASI to ascertain the nature of the pillars and the structure beneath it, the various inscriptions recovered and finally the judgment delivered by the Allahabad High Court after detailed examination of the evidence and testimony from both sides. <br/><br/>The most revealing part of the book is when Dr. Jain exposes the blatant hypocrisy and active misinformation peddled by the Left Historians to discredit any claim of the existence of a Hindu Temple underneath the Masjid and the importance of the site for Hindus. Most notable among these are Prof. Irfan Habib and Prof. Romila Thapar, both of whom went out of their way to continually change their stance from the lack of existence of any temple to claiming it to be Buddhist and Jain structures to then claiming it to be a mosque underneath Babri Masjid and openly refuting the ASI surveys and reports pre-emptively. The court acknowledged this hypocrisy, and Dr.Jain rightly wonders what a damaging effect this handful of historians had on a subject of such national importance. By their admission, none of these historians were even qualified archaeologists, but they still had no qualms in dismissing evidence without justification.<br/><br/>Today, we know the outcome of the Supreme Court verdict, but at the time of this book's writing, we only knew the ruling of the High Court. Despite overwhelming evidence of continued existence since the 13th century BCE and a massive temple structure underneath the mosque, the court still split the site among the three parties, which was not acceptable to the Left Historians and hence moved to the Supreme Court.<br/><br/>On the eve of the Ram Mandir inauguration at Ayodhya next year, this book is an essential reminder of the endless struggles Hindus went through to reclaim their rightful claim to build a temple and worship Lord Rama at his birthplace.<br/>",,,1,0

I was impressed with how the book was structured, and it provides a step-by-step approach to making one's money work for them in different life situations.<br/><br/>Most people lack structure in organizing their finances, don't have good advisors, and tend to make financial decisions out of emotion rather than logic. The author does a fantastic job of walking us through the jargon, different life situations we might be in, and how best we can plan to have a stress-free financial life. The concept of a money box, with separate compartments addressing various aspects of our lives, from savings, emergency funds, medical insurance, equity, retirement, and death, made it relatable and easy to follow.<br/><br/>The author also addresses myths and taboos associated with making wills, our obsession with gold and real estate, and demystifies them with data and many first-hand accounts from her friends and colleagues. <br/><br/>While the book is tailored to an Indian lifestyle, most key learnings apply worldwide. The author repeatedly emphasizes that this book isn't a get-rich overnight recipe but one that points you in the right direction to ensure a healthy financial outlook for yourself and your near and dear ones. The hard work still needs to be done by us to reap the dividends, but this book can act as an excellent reference guide for making critical decisions.",,,1,0

True to his on-screen character, Asheneer gives us a very candid and engaging peek into his life and his journey from being a ""refugee"" to one of India's most prominent startup founders and an inspiration to many. <br/><br/>First, kudos to Ashneer for making this book an easy and accessible despite having a lot of financial jargon. Ashneer doesn't dabble too much in his growing up, and we start with his entering IIT Delhi and later joining IIM Ahmedabad and how he met the love of his life and future wife, Madhuri. After a successful stint as an investment banker with Kotak and Amex, Ashneer dabbles into the entrepreneurship world by joining as Grofers' CFO and eventually building BharatPe from the ground up along with his co-founders. <br/><br/>The transformation of a startup from humble beginnings into a unicorn and the decisions, effort, competition, and luck involved open one's mind to the scale and complexity of the problems at hand. These are also some of the most exciting parts of the book. <br/><br/>Ashneer also gives us a peek into how Shark Tank India made a reclusive private person like him an overnight celebrity. Coincidentally, his appearance on Shark Tank also started his fall from BharatPe.<br/><br/>For every hero, there is a villain. In Ashneer's case, he explains how a combination of his co-founders, investors, legal counsel, and media conspired to oust him and his wife from the company he founded most abruptly. While one empathizes with his story, readers can take it with a pinch of salt as this book is from his POV. <br/><br/>Throughout the book, Ashneer gives us his thought processes and the reasoning behind them, his think-big mentality, the mistakes he regrets, and his relentless drive and hunger to battle against all odds to succeed. These insights make him very relatable and make one aspire to be a startup-founders themselves someday, which I believe is his most significant contribution. <br/><br/>One also realizes that the startup world is not all glitz and glamour. If anything, there are as many challenges as any other, where trust and loyalty play a bigger role than valuation and investors. <br/><br/>Ashneer embodies the Indian startup scene and what we call ""New India."" He encourages the youth to be fearless and aspire to greatness. He wants to see India and Indians become wealthy and create value for the world, and one must applaud him for his contribution to this endeavor.",,,1,0
60643059,The Network State: How To Start a New Country,Balaji S. Srinivasan,"Srinivasan, Balaji S.",,"=""""","=""""",4,3.92,Amazon Kindle,Kindle Edition,262,2022,,2023/06/03,2023/06/02,,,read,"This eponymous book is what one would call a ""Think Big"" initiative - how does one start a new country in the internet age, and what are the various factors at play and viability of this concept in multiple spheres - social, technical, logistical, legal, physical and financial. Balaji is a tech entrepreneur and visionary, and in his first book, he attempts to provide a vision for the future of our planet to move from nation-states to network states. <br/><br/>First, this book is unique in multiple ways - it is available for free to read online but is also not a typical book. Instead, it is version control in book format. Each page of the Network State can be read by referring to its URL, and it will be updated in subsequent versions with newer insights and meanings. It has a ton of references to not just other books but also anything available on the internet. In essence, it is a dynamic book and probably the first of its kind, and kudos to the author for reimagining books this way.<br/><br/>So what is a network state? Balaji gives the definition in one sentence, one image, one thousand words, and one essay. A network state is a social network with a moral innovation, a sense of national consciousness, a recognized founder, a capacity for collective action, an in-person level of civility, an integrated cryptocurrency, a consensual government limited by a social smart contract, an archipelago of crowdfunded physical territories, a virtual capital, and an on-chain census that proves a large enough population, income, and real-estate footprint to attain a measure of diplomatic recognition.<br/><br/>As we can see, there's much to unpack in that definition, which he does in the rest of the book. He elaborates on the why's, the hows, the whats, and the where's associated with them. It is clear as we read the book that Balaji is a student of history, and his ability to consolidate 100s of years of human thought and action and draw parallels with today's world makes for a fascinating read. Much of the initial part of the book is spent on understanding and re-learning history and questions one's fundamental biases and assumptions. At every level, he also provides internet-based, cryptographically secure, and verifiable web3 alternatives to provide a vivid contrast between legacy systems and internet-first ones.<br/><br/>Balaji also goes into depth into political history and strategy and why a founder of a network state needs to understand history. He then makes a fascinating comparison between God, State, and Network and how each axis represents power and influence. We also go into depth on the decline of the USA and the rise of China, how the future can potentially build into a war between the two, and how the network state will be a viable alternative for other nation-states in such an eventuality. <br/><br/>Here he makes a comparison between NYT, CCP, and BTC. That's the American Establishment vs. the Communist Party of China vs the Global Internet. Each of these three poles has a source of truth online: paper (NYT), party (CCP112), or protocol (BTC). Each has a digital economy surrounding that source of truth: the dollar economy, the digital yuan113, or the web3 crypto-economy. Each pole is a network in its own right, which stands outside the state; the NYT network gives direction to the American state, the CCP network leads the Chinese state, and the BTC network stands outside all states.  <br/><br/>Towards the end, we actually come to the specifics of a network state formation. Balaji explains that it has to be in incremental steps, with each step potentially being an end state. Here he connects to various computer science fundamentals to help us visualize a digital-first country that uses AR, VR, cryptography, and other advances to create a 100% opt-in democracy instead of the existing 51% democracy.<br/><br/>He also clarifies that one can't found a network state directly. Instead, you found a startup society which is a social network, then turn it into a network union which makes it a digital community capable of collective action. This network union should have a strong moral premise (such as being keto-free, for example), a sense of national consciousness, and a recognized founder who people choose to follow by joining the community. It is also critical that it has an integrated cryptocurrency that acts as the backbone of the network state. Every state asset, from smart contracts to citizen logins to birth certificates, is on-chain and protected by encryption. <br/><br/>From here, the network union can turn into a network archipelago by manifesting this collective action in the physical world and crowdfunding territory worldwide and connecting them via the internet. Once this on-chain census proves a large enough population, income, and real-estate footprint, we aim to get diplomatic recognition from a pre-existing government, turning the network archipelago into a network state.<br/><br/>While the ideas in this book may be considered wild, there's enough data, exploration, counter-arguments, and depth to believe that this can happen in our future. Balaji spends a lot of time on tangents and repeats his ideas; overall, the book makes one imagine endless possibilities and excitement for the future of human civilization. <br/>",,,1,0

While I still couldn't read the book in Tamil, owing to my language gaps, I managed to read an excellent translation by Pavithra Srinivasan. Translating a text of this scale and grandeur takes work. Still, the author did a fantastic job bringing about Kalki's vivid descriptions of the life and times of 10th-century Chozha Nadu alive.<br/><br/>The story itself is a classic and one we've been accustomed to since the times of the Mahabharata. An ailing emperor is at the mercy of his trusted advisors. Although his eldest son has been earmarked as the crown prince, there are conspirators within the Chozha kingdom who want to upset the established order and place one of their own, the king's nephew, as the crown prince. The ailing emperor in question here is Sundara Chozar, his son Aditha Karikalar the crown prince, and the conspirators, the Pazhuvettarayar brothers, and their associates. The title character is the brother of the crown prince, Arunmozhi Varman, who we today celebrate as Rajaraja Choza I. He appears sparingly in this first book. <br/><br/>The beauty of any historical fiction novel is the ability to connect real and lived people and places with a fictitious and often riveting story. While most of the story is narrated from the perspective of the warrior Vanthiyathevan, we also get to see others' views, so it is not strictly a linear narrative. Here, Kalki excels as he transports the reader back in time and place. <br/><br/>Kalki also gives an excellent overview of the history of Chozhas, Pandiyas, and others, the battles they fought, and the structures they built. We also get a deep understanding of the nature of religion, society, festivals, art, and geography of the time. <br/><br/>Book 1 primarily introduces the key characters, the plot to usurp the Chozha kingdom, and the various thrilling adventures of Vanthiyathevan and Azhwarkaddiyan Nambi, the staunch Vaishnavite priest. We slowly discover the true nature of central characters like Nandini and Kundhavai. The book concludes with Parthibendran Pallavan listening to Aditha Karikalan's tumultuous love affair with Nandini. <br/><br/>Onwards to book 2!<br/> ",,,1,0

Sai Deepak has grown in leaps and bounds as a lawyer, a public speaker, and an inspiration for the youth of India, who are increasingly becoming civilizational aware. Adding to that list is his rise as an author and his second book of the Bhārat trilogy (or is it 4 books now?) -  India, Bhārat, and Pakistan is a testament to this. <br/><br/>Continuing from book one, JSD establishes the continuum of Middle Eastern Coloniality in Bhārat after the Mughal empire's decline. It traces events, personalities, and their impacts, ultimately leading to the Partition of India. The book covers the period starting from 1740 all the way until 1924. It gives a dive deep into history, which is often ignored/under-appreciated when we discuss the freedom movement of India. The seeds of what would eventually become Pakistan were not merely a product of the British divide and rule or the Partition of Bengal in 1905. Rather, they were sown as early as the late 18th century. The book also summarily dismisses the notion of ""Ganga-Jamuni tehzeeb,"" or Hindu-Muslim unity and syncretic culture, and disillusions one completely.  <br/><br/>The book is divided into 3 sections. In section 1, we are given an overview of the different Pan-Islamic movements which started in Bhārat post the decline of the Mughal empire. We are introduced to Shah Waliullah Dehlawi, who inspired various leaders to take up Islamic revivalism, most notably Syed Ahmed Barelvi (Wahhabi movement). While the Wahhabi movement is often portrayed as an Independence movement and a fight against the British, closer analysis reveals how it was a movement to re-establish the religious supremacy of Islam in Bhārat. This is evidenced most notably by their absence in the Mutiny of 1857. <br/><br/>After deeply analyzing the different movements, we are introduced to the architect of the two-nation theory Syed Ahmed Khan. Khan recognized the futility of armed jihad against the British, thus embracing ""modernity"" and combining it institutionally with Islamic education, and founded Aligarh Muslim University. This allowed Muslims to retain their consciousness while the Hindu elites became a core part of colonial infrastructure while sacrificing their indigenity on all fronts. Khan was also the first to forge a ""national"" Muslim identity, which had been elusive thus far.<br/><br/>The other important personality in this section is Syed Jamal al-Din al-Afghani. Afghani played a vital role in entrenching the idea of a global ummah and Khilafat, at least two decades before the birth of the Khilafat movement in 1919. This was to reaffirm the concept of a homeland/central authority to which Muslims worldwide would pay allegiance. Thus, Syed Ahmed Khan and Afghani combined to establish Muslim nationalism and pan-Islamism in Bhārat, which led to catastrophic consequences. <br/><br/>Section 2 explores the creation of the Indian National Congress, the events leading to the partition of Bengal in 1905, the ""Safety-valve"" theory of the British in creating the Indian National Congress, the rise of various revolutionaries and revolutionary movements, and the divisions within the Congress itself as Moderates and Extremists (though fluid in nature). We examine how the British took advantage of pre-existing religious, civilizational, and political divides during the Partition of Bengal. <br/><br/>The partition was a significant moment in India's history. The events leading to it saw the rise of several revolutionary movements. To keep these movements in check, under the leadership of A.O. Hume, the Indian National Congress was established. The primary goal was to relieve the angst of the populace and give a voice while remaining under British influence, to render the revolutionary movements moot. Soon, two factions emerged in the Congress, the revolutionaries (comprising Lal-Bal-Pal) and the moderates (with Gokhale, Banerjea, etc.). There couldn't have been a starker difference between the two groups. The Moderates adopted a British loyalist position and only aimed to secure western democracy under the Crown. The Extremists were nationalists in character and demanded complete independence or Purna Swaraj. <br/><br/>This section also details the Muslim league's formation due to Muslim leaders' fears regarding introducing elective components based on constituencies. We have a detailed analysis of the Minto-Morley reforms and later the Montagu-Chelmsford reforms with primary extracts of the various debates and discussions in the annual meetings of the INC, Muslim League, and the British parliament year after year. <br/><br/>There is also a retrospective of the moderates/extremists thought processes when gathering Muslim support and their respective end goals. However, the need to collaborate with the Muslims only backfired as it kept increasing their demand for concessions, thus compromising Hindu interests at every level. <br/><br/>Finally, section 3 elaborates on the reunification of Bengal, the contribution of Bhārat in the First World War, and the rise of the Khilafat Movement and Gandhi as an influential leader. In particular, the gory details of the Moplah riots make for a spine-chilling read. The book details the riots post the Rowlatt act in Jallianwalla Bagh and the massive destruction caused by Muslims due to the Khilafat stand taken by the British. <br/><br/>We also learn about Gandhi as a staunch British loyalist like the Moderates. He opposed the Home Rule Movement and encouraged passive resistance and Hindus to actively participate and contribute to the Khilafat movement. While the Khilafatists were ready to embrace jihad to secure their goals and use Swaraj to hurt the British, Gandhi did not call for complete independence and even limited means of non-violent methods. His decisions and actions lay waste to his being a ""Mahatma."" Ironically, Jinnah was proved right when he openly challenged Gandhi's idea of non-violent means of resistance, claiming that no independence can be achieved without bloodshed.<br/><br/>In conclusion, the author makes it abundantly clear that this period witnessed the rise of Middle Eastern Coloniality combined with European Coloniality. Bhārat was severely limited in dealing with it due to its dual consciousness. Thus, any reading or interpretation of the independent Bhārat's constitution must consider this history.",,,1,0
40718726,Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World,Jack Weatherford,"Weatherford, Jack",,"=""""","=""""",4,4.06,Broadway Books,Kindle Edition,352,2018,2004,2022/10/17,2016/12/31,,,read,"When we hear 'Genghis Khan,' it brings different images to one's mind, with most depictions portraying him as a fierce warrior and ruthless tyrant from Mongolia who, at one point in time, ruled the world. We think of the thousands of people he butchered, the vast swathes of territories he conquered, and the influence he has on the planet to this day, with 1 in 200 people alive today still considered his direct descendants. But history, as we all know, is never black or white and is ridden with plots and sub-plots and inexplicable nuances which alter its course. And nowhere is this more self-evident than when we read about Temujin Khan (who later became Genghis Khan) and the Mongols and who they really were in this fascinating commentary by Jack Weatherford.<br/><br/>To begin with, what the Mongols achieved as a military civilization is most likely unsurpassed by any other empire/kingdom. In 25 years, the Mongol army subjugated more lands and people than the Romans had conquered in four hundred years. As a measure of the total area occupied, number of people defeated or countries annexed, Genghis Khan conquered more than twice any other man in history. And he achieved all this with a tribe of under a million people and warriors just numbering a hundred thousand. <br/><br/>Khan's military tactics were unique and impressive, and they relied heavily on their fleet of horses during execution. They could easily ride and fight even on frozen rivers and lakes. They also split into two camps, first drawing the enemy and spreading them thinly before launching a swift and brutal attack to subjugate them.<br/><br/>More importantly, they used propaganda very effectively. The terror in people's minds and hearts when they heard the word ""Mongols"" did more damage to their morale than anything else. They inflated the number of people killed in battle and the gruesome way they did it, weakening the enemy even before lifting their swords.<br/><br/>Genghis Khan and his descendants ruled from Europe to Korea, Siberia to India, Vietnam to Hungary, and China to Persia. The scale and scope of his achievements escape any logic or reason. <br/><br/>But there is so much more about the Mongols and Genghis Khan, buried in the sands of time. And it is this journey of the great Khan and his descendants that the author narrates. From his birth to his rise as a tribal leader and, ultimately, a warrior who fiercely fought for his people's safety. His children and grandchildren continued to expand his territories on the firm foundation he established while possibly establishing the first global order based on free trade, single international law, and a universal alphabet to write in all languages.<br/><br/>Khan was fierce and challenged the notions and conventions of his tribe. He smashed the privileges-by-birth system and built one based on merit and loyalty. He also lowered taxes for the public and abolished them for doctors, priests, and educational institutions. He established a census and created the international postal system. And he was not an emperor who conquered for wealth, and all the goods and gold he got from wars were evenly distributed among his folk. The Mongols and Khan were animists and believed in the ultimate supreme law of the Eternal Blue Sky and his spirit banner, which applied to all people. They were egalitarian and secular in their outlook toward all religions. He also abolished torture, refused to hold hostages, and instead instituted the practice of diplomatic immunity for ambassadors end envoys. Those who attacked Mongol ambassadors, though, were brutally eviscerated.<br/><br/>Mongols gave a lot of importance to artists, scientists, astronomers, and men of wisdom in all places they conquered. They realized their value and had a practical outlook toward the conquered territories and their subjects. As the Mongol empire grew over centuries, this exchange of ideas, information, trade, culture, and practices across civilizations and religions gave birth to many innovations in finance, medicine, science, literature, industry, and so on.<br/><br/>The downfall of the Mongols was triggered not by a conquering enemy but rather by a virus - the Black Plague. The plague wreaked havoc across the length and breadth of the Mongol empire, killing millions in the process, diminishing their military strength, and reducing them to trading kingdoms. Eventually, other claimants, like Timur, usurped the Mongol territories while vehemently claiming their descent from the Great Khan to showcase their legitimacy and strength to the public. The Mughals who invaded and ruled India also were descendants of the Mongols.<br/><br/>The Mongols significantly influenced every aspect of Eastern and European life, including technology, warfare, clothing, etc. But, the rise of Europe as a superpower post the 18th century was a blow to the legacy of the Mongols as they were systematically removed from collective memory, with their glowing achievements laying forgotten and their alleged crimes and brutality greatly magnified. This was mainly the result of 19th-century scientists who wanted to show the inferiority of Asian and Eastern populations, even classifying them as Mongoloid. Ultimately, Mongols came to represent failure, barbarity, and uncouthness, becoming a scapegoat for individual and nationalistic shortcomings. <br/><br/>Later in the 20th century, the revisionist history of the Mongols began. It had unlikely champions like Nehru, for example. The author and like-minded folks were part of this revival and went through rigorous and physical hardships to recover the most crucial document telling the story of the Mongols from their own perspective. Known as ""The Secret History of the Mongols,"" it is what forms the foundation of this book.<br/><br/>One cannot narrate the history of humans and civilizations without prominently featuring Genghis Khan and the Mongols. They've withstood the test of time through all their triumphs and failures. ",,,1,0

Although he grew up in a religious household, his time in college during the non-cooperation movement made him skeptical about the existence of God. By reading further, he strengthened his conviction until he finally convinced himself that there does not exist an omnipresent supreme being who created and controlled the universe. <br/><br/>Singh makes some basic arguments about why such a God cannot exist by drawing parallels with the suffering and destruction and unfairness in life and that a benevolent God wouldn't let these happen in the first place. He also thinks people believed in God and orthodox religion because we've become lethargic and aren't developing the ideas of our ancient thinkers. He emphasizes the importance of reasoning and questioning beliefs. <br/><br/>By reading this essay, one can sense the man's anguish and the difficulties he faced during his lifetime. One must also appreciate that he took on a society that was much more hostile to such ideas at the time and stood by it until his death. However, it does seem that Singh did not have an in-depth understanding of the nature of God, religion, and the nature of life, especially from a Hindu perspective. The existence of an omnipresent, all-knowing, and all-conquering God is mostly an Abrahamic worldview, unlike Dharmic faiths, which are more nature-oriented.

This is because one doesn't connect with the characters, the plot, or the setting it is in, even though it is in the familiar fictional world of Malgudi. However, it does have a few highlights, which made it an interesting read. <br/><br/>For one, the titular character Sampath is introduced through the lens of another character named Srinivas. Sampath is the editor Srinivas stumbles upon to help print his journal ""The Banner"" and pulls through various obstacles to keep the journal afloat. Srinivas's thoughts and echoes form the reader's perspective throughout the book, not Sampath's.<br/><br/>We trace the camaraderie between them, their families' backgrounds, their meetings, and eventually ""The Banner"" being shut down due to unforeseen circumstances. While Srinivas is lost on how to revive his journal, Sampath pivots to the grand vision of setting up a studio and directing a film. How Sampath's character slowly unravels over time and how Srinivas realizes truths about the way of life make up the rest of the story.<br/><br/>There are familiar character sketches, as always. We have an old man set in his ways, a friend of Srinivas lost in thoughts of a dame he saw many years ago, a wife annoyed with her husband's lack of attention, and their kid who's oblivious to the family's distresses. But while they all individually have depth, the story itself lacks it. And, of course, Narayan's inimitable English writing style shines through regardless.<br/><br/>Narayan touches upon aspects of the early post-Independence era very pleasingly, and one does get enchanted by the life and times of people then. He also showcases the caste system, religion, dynamics of relationships, and even mental health through his characters. The simplicity and calmness with which they express themselves do make one thoughtful.",,,1,0

India, in particular, has immense diversity when it comes to language and dialects, which have existed for millennia. Post the colonial rule, there has been a marked shift towards the English language being the aspirational goal to improve one's life at the expense of our native languages. This book provides a factual counter to many of the myths prevalent about the supposedly inescapable need for the English language and policy suggestions to address this problem. <br/><br/>While the book is loaded with data, the author's arguments primarily rest on three main aspects. First, that research consistently points to mother tongue education best for a child's cognitive, social, and cultural development. The best-performing countries in terms of GDP per capita have the highest form of education available in their native tongue. In contrast, the lowest-performing ones have their education in a foreign language. These countries also use their mother tongue for science, technology, higher education, law, and business.<br/><br/>Second, the systematic state policy of pushing English as the only language for the highest echelons of the government, be it the courts, administrative services, or the armed forces, presents a glass ceiling for most citizens of India. They neither have the means nor the environment to acclimatize to a foreign language. This results in active discrimination by the state against its citizens and penalizes them for not knowing a language not native to them.<br/><br/>Third, with the advent of the IT sector, there is a demand for  English fluent candidates, even while MNCs worldwide work and hire in the local languages of the countries they operate in. This forcing of English for supposed economic benefits is both culturally and economically devastating. It leads to the increased devaluation and erasure of Indian languages. They're slowly being relegated to being languages of literature.<br/><br/>To be clear, the author doesn't recommend an overhaul of the English language altogether, nor adopt a new standard or uniform language. Instead, he provides various solutions to address this problem from the primary to senior levels. For example, changing the importance of English from a medium of instruction to only a language used for communication would go a long way in strengthening our hold and confidence in our languages. He also provides suggestions for uniform scripts which can be easily translated across languages and mentions the role technology can play in bridging this gap. <br/><br/>Finally, the author goes through case studies of different countries that have adopted their native languages for their usage. Most notable among these is Israel, which revived Hebrew (an almost dead language). Within a century, it has one of the best technical universities in the world. Other examples include China and Japan. <br/><br/>This book serves only as a starting point to understand the enormous implications of language policies on our populace. At the very least, it should make us step back and think about the path we are heading as unwitting proponents of the English language.<br/><br/>",,,1,0

The author provides a blow-by-blow account of the battles, culture, lifestyle, arts, and other aspects of the kingdom, which spanned over 300 years.<br/><br/>Before delving into the formation of the empire, we are given a brief historical account of the various Islamic invasions and their steady capture of different kingdoms in the north before proceeding south. <br/><br/>As the Khalji and Tughlaq dynasty conquered the Deccan region by defeating the Hoysala, Kakatiya, and Yadava kingdoms, the Vijayanagara kingdom was founded in 1336 to fight the Muslim invasion of South India.<br/><br/>Harirhara I and Bukka Raya founded this empire under the able guidance of their patron saint Vidyaranya Swamy. From its founding, the empire reached its peak under the great Krishna Deva Raya and ultimately met its fall at the battle of Talikota. <br/><br/>The murky waters of managing a kingdom, the constant battles between their primary opponents, the Bahamani Sultans and other Hindu kings to gain territory, and the various alliances formed make it a stimulating read. All is not black and white when it comes to managing an empire, and at multiple points, the Vijayanagara kings allied against Bahamanis to defeat a common enemy. <br/><br/>The empire commanded a vast army, artillery, cavalry, and war elephants at its peak. It delivered crushing defeats to the Bahamanis and other kingdoms, thus playing a crucial role as the Hindu bastion of the South. One also sees a recurring theme of forts and the Tungabhadra river being the most vital parts to be captured and where the power center lay.<br/><br/>Many Vijayanagara kings, most notably Krishna Deva Raya, were patrons of arts, including literature and Carnatic music, and this period is considered the golden age of Telugu literature. The capital city Hampi was a thriving cultural center, and some of the most outstanding scholars and writers of the era assembled there. There was also a flourishing sea trade with China, and exports included cotton, spices, jewelry, and perfumes. <br/><br/>The author also explains that the caste system, untouchability, and sati were quite common. However, it did not play a significant role in the administration and the military. Although the rulers were primarily Shaivites, there was religious toleration for all religions.<br/><br/>The fall of this great empire comes at the battle of Talikota, which the author primarily attributes to the short-sightedness of the rulers, post-Krishna Deva Raya's demise, in trying to play the Sultans against each other. The Bahamanis waged a joint campaign against the empire. They razed the city, its temples, and its forts to the ground and massacred thousands of people in the process.	<br/><br/>A fascinating tale of the rise and fall of a Hindu empire from which many lessons can be learned and adapted for today's circumstances.",,,1,0

Arti Agarwal provides a concise research-based summary of the challenges in today's world due to meat consumption and the ecosystem enabling it.<br/><br/>The Cow has been worshipped and revered since the Vedic times in India. Its utility and impact on the wellbeing of family and society are immeasurable. Hence, it is bewildering to realize that such a society is now one of the leading exporters of beef in the world. The author painstakingly details the root cause of this degeneration in this book. <br/><br/>From the Cow being a sentient being, to the carbon footprint due to the cattle and dairy industry, the economic and environmental cost to produce the meat that we consume, the poisoning of our food, air, soil, and water as a result of harmful agricultural practices, the clearing of the rainforests, the exploitation of animals by the food and leather industry and the immeasurable suffering caused, and the cost to human life due to the working conditions, etc., we are presented a barrage of sobering facts which get mind-numbing after a point. The scale at which we exploit natural resources has reached stratospheric levels and will cause irreversible damage unless we drastically change our anything-for-profit approach.<br/><br/>The author also explains the remarkable characteristics of the Cow and how everything it generates can be used for fertilizers, biogas, producing clean energy, medicinal purposes, etc. With ""Cownomics,"" she posits a framework that can be developed to live a sustainable, humane, ethical, and environmentally conscious way of life centered around the Cow.<br/><br/>One interesting aspect was the author's coinage of the term ""karmic footprint"" of an activity, which she defines as the measure of the amount of violence, suffering, or pain that action has caused to living beings. Including the Karmic footprint in our cost-benefit analysis would make us re-think many of our existing systems.<br/><br/>A thought-provoking read on the urgent need to change our habits and, more importantly, our approach to life itself if we are to have any hope of sustaining on this planet.",,,1,0

This also means that we have access to breaking news events happening anywhere in the world at our fingertips, within a few seconds of the events unfolding. It is, thus, easy to forget that as recently as two decades ago, the source of news media was primarily the monopoly of either state-owned news channels or private organizations with their agendas. This was particularly acute in India, and one would be hard-pressed to find anything but morbidity in the news reported and consumed by millions back then.<br/><br/>It was this depressing scenario that the author D.V Sridharan decided to question as he wondered how this country continues to endure when nothing seems to be proper here. Are we just a bunch of people who whine and complain? Surely, there must be good samaritans there contributing to this great country and civilization?<br/><br/>Armed with these questions, at the age of 58, he decided to travel across the length and breadth of the country, hoping to find answers and document them. Between 2000 and 2006, Sridharan discovered the people who made India tick and recorded their work in his blog - goodnewsindia.com. Some of the best stories from that website are what constitute this book. One must say that the stories definitely inspire anyone who cares for this country and its success.<br/><br/>The people DV encounters range from Anna Hazare, who energized the villagers of his town Ralegaon to bring back its glory, to Saalumarada Thimmakka, who, along with her husband, planted trees and cared for them like her own children. We learn about The Banyan's service in restoring the confidence of abandoned women and showing how to be humane and the Bishnois, who are the world's first environmentalists, and their ferocious protection of nature around them. <br/><br/>There are many stories of organizations started by individuals to restore agricultural practices, restore an ecosystem from arid and drylands, and preserve and promote nature. One which was particularly noteworthy was Sulabh, an organization dedicated to eradicating the practice of manual scavenging. A common theme among these people is that they were all inspired by Mahatma Gandhi. There has been a lot of revision on how Gandhi is looked at in recent years, but the fact remains that he was a colossal figure responsible for creating grassroots leaders who solved complex problems.<br/><br/>The author ends by reminding us how he hopes these stories inspire people to start their own initiatives and not take them as assertions that all is well with India. He also speaks about his ""point of return"" theory of how human life must consist of venturing and returning, and wisdom lies in knowing when to do both.

Our history books still teach AIT as the primary theory of how we acquired our languages and culture. Few people are even aware of the alternative approach known as the Out of India Theory (OIT) and how it counters the AIT.<br/><br/>Traditionally the debate has been discussed on three academic disciplines: Linguistics, Archaeology, and Inscriptional data. In its latest iteration, a new field has come into play: Genetics. In this book, Shri Shrikant Talageri produces a detailed and highly critical response to a book named ""Early Indians"" written by Tony Joseph, who argues that the AIT has been conclusively proved due to genetic evidence uncovered in 2018.<br/><br/>The author does a fantastic job of meticulously dissecting every ""evidence"" propounded by Tony Joseph by countering it with factual data and calling out the propaganda underlying the arguments of the former. Whether it be migration patterns, genetic evidence, chronological evidence, textual evidence in the Rig Veda, geographical evidence of the rivers mentioned, and even the evidence on horses, Shri Shrikant Talageri proves how genetics has no bearing on the debate of the Homeland, i.e., the common origin of the Indo-European languages. <br/><br/>Throughout the book, the author decisively proves the case for OIT and uses the genetic evidence to further establish how OIT makes even more sense now, instead of the contrary.<br/><br/>What was gratifying about the book was the easy-to-understand manner he explains and provides context to the debate. A word of appreciation should also be given to Shri Koenraad Elst, who, in his foreword, beautifully articulates the history of this debate and its implications and the approach both sides should be taking as academics and not indulge in mudslinging.<br/><br/>A must-read for not just AIT/OIT enthusiasts but anyone interested in the origins of where we came from.",,,1,0

It is always awe-inspiring to read the boldness and clarity of thought employed by Sita Ram Goel, especially given the era he lived in and the opposition he faced. This book is no different than many of his other works, like India's Secularism.<br/><br/>SRG makes a case for the Hindu society by highlighting that its spiritual center, Sanatana Dharma, has always sustained the Hindu community, especially during the onslaught of Islamic and Christian invasions. He claims that reviving this spiritual center is the only way Hindu society can be revitalized.<br/><br/>He echoes that we need to evaluate our ideologies in our terms and world view and not in an imperialist ethnocentric manner. He makes a mockery of oft-touted Hindu phrases like (ekam sad viprah bahudha vadanti and Sarva-dharma-samabhava, the latter coined by Mahatma Gandhi) and how Hindu society has tried to mold itself into a monotheistic framework to be accepted by such creeds. <br/><br/>SRG then explores Hindu spirituality and consciousness and its greatness. He explains why we have different concrete images and millions of Gods as forms are the way the sense-bound human mind can reach something of higher spiritual knowledge. Sanatana Dharma aspires for absolute truth, goodness, beauty, and power in every human being and explores human consciousness. And the way to God-discovery is through self-discovery. He compares this to other polytheistic cultures that existed worldwide before Christianity and Islam went about eliminating them almost entirely. <br/><br/>He then expounds on why Christianity and Islam impede the path of spiritual progress and divide humanity into warring camps using words like infidel and kafir. They profess to one almighty god with a prophet or savior to escape from eternal hell or be admitted to eternal heaven. A study of the genesis of these theologies explains why they're not mere religions but are political ideologies with imperialist ambitions. He also shares personal anecdotes of his experiences with Muslim Sufis and Christian mystics. They were on the same path of universal spirituality as Sanatana Dharma but were forced to serve the ambitions of the theocratic nature of these states.<br/><br/>Finally, he explains how Nehruvain ideologues perverted the meaning of Secularism and the way out for Hindu society by acknowledging Islam and Christianity for what they represent and reviving its spiritual center. A short book that packs a punch. <br/><br/>",,,1,0

But the story that every tennis fan and casual observer of the sport this millennium has been waiting for is that of the tennis legend Roger Federer. The Master, by Christopher Clarey, a noted sports journalist, is one of the most well-written biographies of its time and was a joy to read.<br/><br/>The Master chronicles the life of Roger Federer comprehensively. Covering all aspects of his storied life from his childhood, his immigrant parents, his training in Switzerland, his struggles with controlling his emotions, his girlfriend and future wife Mirka and their sets of twins, his rise to fame as a global phenomenon, his key rivals Nadal and Djokovic and milestone matches in his career and their aftermath and even his business interests. <br/><br/>While most of his professional achievements are well chronicled in public life, it was still interesting to get a first-person view of what goes into the mind of a champion of Federer's caliber. His vision for the game, not just for his own career but for tennis as a whole, was fascinating to read. The author also gives us a keen sense of how important luck is in shaping the careers of such people and how things could have been so different if they weren't at the right place at the right time. <br/><br/>The kind of awe Federer instilled in both his admirers and his peers and competitors tells a lot about the type of tennis genius he is. The interviews with different players provided fantastic insight and were the most enjoyable part of the book.<br/><br/>The author does due diligence to not just paint Federer as a saint and brings out different moments in his career where he wasn't at his exemplar best, and re-affirming to the rest of us that he was still human. Most notable among these were Federer's outbursts against Djokovic after he won after facing matching points and against his compatriot Stan Wawrinka during the Davis Cup.<br/><br/>Overall, The Master is the closest we've gotten yet to understanding the phenomenon that is Roger Federer. I can't wait to read an autobiography someday.",,,1,0

And yet, that is precisely what lawyer J Sai Deepak has achieved in his first of a proposed trilogy of books on Bharat and Bharatiya consciousness. <br/><br/>There is so much packed within this book that it is hard for any review to do justice. The book highlights not just the author's diligent research in combing through tons of material on decolonial scholarship, laws, debates, and events that shaped the origins of India's constitution but also his unique sense of narration and coherence to tie it all together. The end result is a comprehensive examination of everything related to our civilization and how we perceive it, most notably in the spheres of religion, nature, history, education, and constitutionalism.<br/><br/>Split into 3 parts (as described in the title), the book weaves a thread on how coloniality, civilization, and the constitution of Bharat are intertwined. The book's overarching theme is decoloniality and why the decolonial lens is the ONLY way we need to look at our history and constitution. The following paragraphs illustrate how the author makes this case.<br/><br/>We get an in-depth view to understand what decoloniality means and how it differs from other schools of thought like modernism, post-modernism, and post-colonialism. Summarizing this in the author's words - ""the decolonial framework seeks to reinscribe the primacy of indigeneity, indigenous consciousness and its subjectivity in formerly colonized societies and civilizations."" He also explains the difference between colonization, colonialism, and coloniality and how it excludes native perspectives. <br/><br/>We are then exposed to the nature of colonization and how it affected the consciousness of our people to such an extent that the only way the native felt they could redeem their dignity was by ""adopting European culture and thought processes"". It made them forget and detest their own roots and made them think of their past and history as a colossal failure, thus undermining their self-confidence. The entire colonization process aims at universalizing and standardizing ways of life instead of allowing the diversity of different groups and societies to flourish. <br/><br/>This, in turn, leads one to ask how the colonizer's mindset was formed, to begin with, and it is here that we were taken back to the voyages of Christopher Columbus in the 15th century. Its fundamental Christian and proselytizing nature is elaborately delved into. The much-celebrated ""Secularism"" and its origins are traced to the ""Peace of Westphalia"" treaty. We learn how the distinction between spiritual and secular was drawn from within the Christian framework and not outside it. Today, the international laws and treaties applied to non-western ""nation-states"" are all rooted in Protestant Reformation-inspired Westphalian principles. <br/><br/>We then discover that these principles led them to a ""civilizing"" and ""reformation"" mission of the non-Christian world and thus uprooting the collective lived experiences and traditions of indigenous societies the world over. The Christian approach to nature as a means of exploitation was fundamentally the opposite of that of Indic systems that lived in harmony with nature. We are shown how the colonial approach has played out in different parts of the world, especially in Latin America and how the decolonial system needs to revisit each country's individual experience and their own history. In Bharat's case, we are introduced to Middle Eastern Coloniality as a predecessor of European coloniality and why it should be looked at through the same lens. While Middle Eastern Coloniality was defended against by the natives owing to its ""in-your-face"" nature, the end goals of European coloniality were much more oblivious. The author emphasizes how every stratum of our society bears a colonial stamp and why it is essential to judge all of our social structures, religion, polity, economics, and law using a decolonial approach and rejecting European-centric ideas.<br/><br/>In the final part, the author analyzes the role of Christian secularism and gives a sneak-peek into whether it had an influence during the framing of the Government of India act of 1919, which formed the basis for our constitution later. Debates and discussions in European parliament about the Company's role, later brought under the Queen's rule, are explored. They provide chilling insights into how the British empire wanted to subjugate the people of Bharat in all aspects. The European approach to look at Indic philosophies and traditions from their ethnocentric lens resulted in them superimposing their worldview on Indic traditions. While Sanatana Dharma encompasses all aspects of life, the Christian colonizer reduced it to be a ""religion"" of ""books."" We are made aware of how these standardizations and laws percolate to this day, resulting in government control of Hindu temples in a supposedly ""secular"" state. <br/><br/>Education is another aspect where the colonizer went to great lengths to erase any sense of pride associated with their past and history, as amply illustrated by Macaulay's famous ""Minute on Education."" <br/><br/>Even during the peak of the European colonization of Bharat, many scholars stood up prominently against it. They challenged the notion of Bharat not being a united entity before their arrival, and the author cites various examples for this. Even as late as the early 20th century, we had leaders keenly aware of this cultural continuity. He also illustrates how the framers of the constitution were aware of this civilizational consciousness which is why Article 1 of the constitution states, ""India that is Bharat."" Still, post Independence, this consciousness has steadily been withering away. <br/><br/>If there is one thing I believe the author wants the reader to take from this book, it is to be aware of our biases and internal coloniality and how we came to our present situation. Reading this book brought out my underlying disgust for British and European colonization and reaffirmed my belief in Bharatiya culture and values. The author makes a pop-culture reference to the movie Matrix in this book. I can confidently say that this book is the ultimate red pill for any Bharatiya and will completely change our perspective on how we look at Bharat forever. ",,,1,0

In the process, Subramanian Swamy touches upon different aspects of India and expands on what he calls ""The Modern Right Framework"".<br/><br/>Swamy gives a hurried overview of the Hindu civilization, the Vedas, Upanishads, and Sanatana Dharma. He then goes into some detail in analyzing the constitutional approach to the majority and minority question and the various judgments delivered by the  Hon'ble Supreme court in this regard. In particular, the dichotomy between Article 25 and Article 30 is brought out (individual rights vs. group minority rights). Swamy highlights that the core problem at the root of this is the lack of confidence and confusion among today's Indians. The confusion lies in whether the Republic of India, founded in 1947, is a legatee of ancient Hindu India or a new nation altogether. He stresses the need for the majority Hindus and dharmic faiths and the minority Muslims to understand who we are to help diffuse the communal tensions and strengthen national integrity. <br/><br/>Swamy then delves into the problem of falsified history in our history textbooks and the damage caused by Marxist and left-leaning academia. He analyzes the chronology of Indian kings and Itihasas and Puranas as expounded by Western Indologists. Swamy points that their dating system is entirely wrong due to using a single account of Megasthenes' history of India to map Sandrocottus with Chandragupta Maurya. Swamy provides his own timeline, which dates Indian history much earlier and explains India has been a continuous and unbroken civilization. He also talks about the first war of Independence in 1857 and how these historians deliberately reduced its importance to being a ""Sepoy Mutiny.""<br/><br/>Finally, we learn about the ""Integral Humanism"" proposed by Deendayal Upadhyaya. This is a new ideological framework that puts the economic and spiritual development of the human at the center. It includes the concept of ""Chiti"" (soul) of a nation which each nation must discover to decide the correct formulation of its economic policy. He puts this in contrast with existing ideologies like Capitalism, Communism, and Democratic Socialism and how they all ignore the growth of an individual and hence are flawed. <br/><br/>Swamy makes a case for Sanksrit as the link language which Indians should strive towards and how eventually Hindi should become indistinguishable from Sanskrit. Since most of our texts are Sanskrit-based, he believes this is the approach we need to take to learn from the ocean of resources.<br/><br/>Some parts of this book were repetitive/not appropriately edited, making it less coherent. Still, overall, it was a decent read. ",,,1,0

Sultan of Delhi wasn't as thrilling or racy as the former, as it is set in a very different environment.<br/><br/>The book spans the life of Arjun Bhatia, the primary character of this story. It documents his move to India at the time of partition and his rise, fall, and rise again in the power circles of India. The author does a reasonably good job capturing the milieu of post-independence India, the emergency period, and the liberalization eras. He paints a picture of rampant corruption, drugs, guns, foul language as politicians, underworld dons, and laymen are weaved into this tale. <br/><br/>At times, the narration sounds a bit filmy, which makes one wonder if the book was written to be made into a movie. The casual references to the CIA, the Russians, and other players don't add to the narrative. There is an emotional undercurrent to the tale and a revenge saga with certain plot twists.

Two broad camps exist around the duties of a government. One is the libertarian idea that they're inefficient and incompetent. Thus, they should play a minimal role and let the market and civil society run the economy. The other is the statist view which considers governments to be all-powerful and the only means to drive community and economy. <br/><br/>What is indeed the role of a government, what are the different models in which they can operate, what dangers may lie with trusting the government too much, and the competence with which they can implement programs to serve the need of the citizens? It is these core questions which this book tries to tackle and address. Finally, it also guides the role citizens should play to ensure a vibrant society with a government that can serve the people's needs. <br/><br/>The author, Jaideep Prabhu, views the functioning of various governments across the world from a variety of lenses. The breadth of subjects covered is too much to elaborate on in a review. For example, he talks about the historical context of the origins of a socialist approach to planning versus lack of government intervention (Hayek vs. Keynes). He looks at how privatization led to the rise of the US and UK as global superpowers, but how, over time, the lack of financial regulations led to economic crashes and booms and bust cycles. This approach is contrasted with the rise of the Asian tigers and China. There, we are made aware of the possibilities with a market controlled by the state. Similarly, various lessons governments can learn based on successful and failed governance models, from private individuals and organizations to governments themselves, are analyzed in great depth to provide a nuanced and critical view. <br/><br/>One of the recurring themes in the book is the need for governments to adapt to technology to solve problems. The author notes the efficiency of top tech companies like Amazon, Google, and Facebook and how they can achieve incredible penetration and offer services to their users while employing very few people. He envisions governments to achieve a similar efficiency by using similar tools. <br/><br/>Conducting experiments were both highly beneficial in producing conclusive results and analyzing the impact of government actions and thus providing better services to the citizens while helping citizens be more responsible. Things that were particularly noteworthy to me were the working of the experimentation unit (The Nudge Unit) in the UK, which took a bottom-up approach to solve citizen problems by understanding the psychological reasons behind citizens' needs instead of considering them as monolithic templates. Similarly, the employment of mobile-based technology in Bangladesh (a21) and Kenya (M-PESA) has proved highly successful for the same reasons.  <br/><br/>The book concludes by highlighting that innovation and market creation require the state and the market to work together and not at odds with each other. The role of the citizens is crucial as well in not just identifying and electing good leaders but keeping tabs on them during their time in power and constantly re-assessing the terms of the social contract. And to protest, if necessary. <br/><br/>An eye-opening book into the world of governments and governance models. ",,,1,0

In this book, he talks about the meaning of Secularism as it originated in the West, and how it's context has been contorted and turned on its head in India. A comparison between the pagan or Advaita philosophies, with that of monotheistic religions follows, and we get to see why secularism as it's defined in the West is, in the author's words, like ""holding a lamp to the Sun"", in India. <br/><br/>We also are given an overview of the scriptural and philosophical differences between the religions of the book, and the dharmic religions based on Santana Dharma. It makes us understand that the two are in different planes, and cannot even be compared to each other. <br/><br/>The book also includes a chapter on the emerging national vision for India, and how we need to get back to the ideals and goals laid down by our leaders during the Swadeshi movement, in order to emerge as the leading nation and as an exemplary example to the rest of the world.<br/><br/>Sita Ram Goel is unabashed in his criticism of other religions, and it comes from a deep understanding and study of their scriptures. He is scathing in his criticisms of Hindus as well, and calls out the collective failure of Hindus at various points of time in the history of India where they could have established the dharmic way of life once again.<br/><br/>In today's day and age, where people are instantly branded based on their religion, whether they adhere to it's values or not, and where Secularism has become an alternative term for minority appeasement, it is books like these which can help every Indian understand their place in history and reinvigorate them towards the vision set out by their forefathers.",,,1,0

Although that is the book's primary focus, it also gives the historical context for why bitcoin came into existence. The author, Antony Lewis, explains the various attempts at creating an instrument that was censorship-resistant and didn't involve a third party. He then talks about the history of money itself, right from the barter system to the fiat money we use today.  <br/><br/>The author starts with THE white paper written by the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto, who described the original framework of how bitcoin would work. He explains how we can create a distributed trust network to exchange digital currency, eliminating fraud using the concept of ""proof-of-work"". He describes the inner workings of bitcoin and ethereum and forks in cryptocurrencies.  We also learn about various hacks and improvements which have been made in cryptocurrencies over the years. The author goes on to explain the different terminologies associated with tokens in the crypto universe. He explains the difference between asset tokens, utility tokens, etc. <br/><br/>A common challenge with cryptocurrencies is understanding what makes them valuable. The author dives deep to explain this with various examples and comparisons with fiat money, which doesn't have any intrinsic value. In some sense, cryptocurrencies are like gold. They are intrinsically valuable and are not tokens that are ""backed"" by some asset.<br/><br/>Finally, we get an understanding of blockchain technology, the differences between private and public blockchains, and the various applications for which they're being used today. We also learn about ICO's (Initial Coin Offerings), how they are priced, the role of cryptocurrency exchanges, and how the future of blockchain can change the world.<br/><br/>As a cryptocurrency and technology enthusiast, this book hit the nail on the head. It is a thorough and yet accessible book for anyone interested in learning the basics of cryptocurrencies and blockchain. ",,,1,0

The term ""Sanghi"" has been tarnished and manipulated by an ecosystem to be a term of derision and hate. If you're associated with a particular political outfit, organization or are simply assertive of your religious identity, you're labeled ""Sanghi."" <br/><br/>And this is where the author, Rahul Roushan, begins his semi-autobiographical tale, expounding on his personal transformation from being a libertarian to a ""Sanghi"" over the years, with the political backdrop of India. In this process, he touches upon many spheres and ideas - the Hindu identity, the hypocrisy of the left-liberals in India, and their dominant control of narratives, making a fallacious distinction between Hinduism and Hindutva, etc. He provides an insightful comparison between different historical and political incidents and even labels (Brahmins vs. Sufis, Kashmiri Pandits vs. Babri Masjid, etc.) to elucidate this duplicity. <br/><br/>There are two key themes the author explores during the book. One is the mindset of a ""Congressi Hindu."" This is someone who has a sense of belonging to being Hindu but doesn't really understand the theological or political basis of this identity. Thus they are ever willing to accommodate and adjust the expanse of this identity. The second is on ""responsible journalism."" With his experience working with media outlets and then being an editor himself, Rahul exposes the patterns of Indian journalism to the reader. Most media houses believe that they're doing the responsible act of maintaining communal harmony by under-reporting or changing narratives based on whether a Muslim is a perpetrator or a victim. <br/><br/>Finally, he speaks about the growing insecurities within the Congress, the various scams, and Narendra Modi's rise as a man who gave hope to millions of regular Indians. He speaks of Modi's pro-development and pro-India outlook compared to the Congress and the visceral attacks on him post-2014 by attributing every incident to divisiveness and breach in communal harmony.  He also explains the crucial role of the rise of the internet and social media platforms like Twitter, which allowed for countering the agenda and questioning the media's ideological bias. The BJP's consecutive victory with a bigger majority in 2019 is a vindication of the mistrust of the Indian voter on the""ecosystem"" and how they need to introspect on their attitudes and behavior.<br/><br/>This book definitely hit home in many ways. I can see how many people, especially in my age group, can relate to Rahul's story of becoming a ""Sanghi"" without ever visiting a ""Shakha."" An excellent read to understand the media and narrative building over the years in India. ",,,1,0

It is not often that one views India from a judicial perspective, and 10 Judgements That changed India does precisely that. By analyzing landmark judgments by the highest court of the land in the decades post-independence, the author vividly paints how our country's law and constitution have impacted its turn of events and evolved to their current state.<br/><br/>Of the 10 judgments discussed, there are famous ones like Kesavananda Bharati vs. the State of Kerala, where the Supreme Court came up with the basic structure doctrine to analyze constitutional amendments, and Shah Bano vs. Mohammed Ahmed Khan, where the sanctity of personal religious law was brought to the forefront. But there are also lesser-known cases discussed in great detail, like Nilabati Behera vs. State of Orissa, where the right to compensation for violating Article 21 was crystallized, and Aruna Shanbaug vs. Union Of India where the decision on euthanasia and the circumstances where it can be allowed were decided. <br/><br/>In reading the lead-up and aftermath of these judgments, the author lucidly explains the laws' historical background and the various challenges before the Supreme Court as it made its decisions. We learn about the different fundamental rights and their applicability, the nuances in interpretations of articles in the constitution, and the executive, legislature, and judiciary's role as the framers of the constitution envisioned it. We also see how the Supreme court went beyond its ambit many times to establish the rule of law, reversed its own decisions many times, and even criticized them. This is highlighted in Supreme Court Advocates-on-Record Association vs. Union of India, where it granted itself too much power to determine judges' appointments. <br/><br/>It was also interesting to note how the executive and legislature reacted to the judgments which weren't in their favor. The most famous among these was the aftermath of Kesavananda Bharati which led to the emergency and drastic amendments of the constitution and appointment and transfer of various judges going against protocol. The checks and balances between the 3 pillars of our democracy have routinely been strained. This makes one realize how it is a privilege to live in a democratic society that allows these pillars to operate fluidly. <br/><br/>The Supreme Court is held in high esteem in India as the last bastion of hope for the common man. It is truly a testament to its dedication to uphold the rule of law and establish justice as it sees fit. This book is a must-read for law enthusiasts and anyone curious to understand the judicial history of India. ",,,1,0

To the uninitiated, there are broadly two schools of thought concerning the origins of early Indians - The Aryan Invasion Theory(AIT)/Aryan Migration Theory(AMT) and the Out of India Theory (OIT). <br/><br/>The AIT claims that there was an original Dravidian populace (Harappan civilization) native to India. These tribes were driven southwards by invading/migrating ""Aryans"" from the West (Steppes) around 1500 BCE who established the Vedic society and ""brought"" language(Sanskrit), culture, and religion (Hinduism) to India. <br/><br/>The OIT theorizes the opposite. It claims that early Indians were native to India. The Harappan civilization and the Vedic civilizations are one and the same. And, the migration of people and language happened from east to west instead. <br/><br/>A.L Chavda, a theoretical physicist, debunks AIT/AMT in this book by citing the latest research and data in archeology and genetics and their results. The data indicates a continuing civilization from the 6th millennium BCE (site Bhirranna on the now-defunct Saraswati River). The  Sarasvati River is mentioned as a mighty river in the Rig Veda, which confirms it was composed close to 5000 BCE and not during the supposed Aryan migration much later. He also expanded on the origin of the R1a haplogroup in India from a single male ancestor 15000 years ago. These and a mountain of other evidence and research papers clearly demonstrate that the AIT as a theory holds no ground.<br/><br/>In the postscript, he laments on the leftist narrative in academia in India and how it is important to assert our position in India and globally. He also mentions the need to invest money and infrastructure in genetic research, which is lacking in India today. ",,,1,0

Ambedkar,"Ambedkar, B.R.",,"=""""","=""""",5,4.61,Delhi Open Books,Kindle Edition,61,2020,1936,2020/12/29,2020/12/23,,,read,"Annihilation of Caste is a publication of the undelivered speech written in 1936 by B.R Ambedkar for the Jat-Pat Todak Mandal. The Jat-Pat Todak Mandal initially invited Ambedkar to deliver a lecture on the Caste System's ills. They later withdrew their invitation as they found the content of the speech objectionable. Ambedkar went ahead and published his speech on his own. It is considered one of his landmark speeches. It raises many pertinent questions on the caste system as it prevailed and the need for reform within the Hindu religion.<br/><br/>The book's overarching argument is that we need societal freedom before we achieve political and economic freedom, primarily from the caste system's shackles. Ambedkar outlines the prevailing discrimination based on the caste system by citing various examples. He argues how control of one man over the other is flawed. ""The caste system is not merely a division of labor but also a division of laborers,"" he says. He mentions that caste's intrinsic nature prevents Hindus from being united beyond their respective caste groups and inhibits solidarity. He explores varna and castes and elaborates how the chaturvarna system is not better than the thousands of castes. It is still fundamentally based on the same division. He explains how an ideal society can be determined by how free are the interplays between various associations in the community.<br/><br/>Ambedkar delves further into the caste system's firm belief among Hindus and determines the Shastras' sanctity as the primary reason. He says Hindus should discard the Shastras and deny their authority to escape the caste system. He emphasizes the need for Hindus to examine their religion and consider what they must conserve and transmit to future generations. He also criticizes the foundations, claiming there is nothing Sanatan or eternal about it. That revolution and change is the law of life.<br/><br/>In the appendix of the book, Mahatma Gandhi's response to his speech and Ambedkar's point by point rebuttal of Gandhi's response is included. This also makes for a very insightful commentary.<br/><br/>Ambedkar's books are always fascinating to read, primarily because of his erudite scholarship and how he presents his arguments. Although I felt that the book is an adequate resource to understand caste's societal implications, it doesn't hold ground as a reference for the caste system/ Hinduism. Ambedkar's understanding of Hinduism as a religion, its foundational texts, and its essence was lacking. Hindus and Hindu society have been continuously undergone reforms both constitutionally and morally since the speech was delivered. Ultimately, it serves as a reminder of how far along we've come on untouchability and discrimination and how much further we need to go. ",,,1,0
55113363,A New Idea of India: Individual Rights in a Civilisational State,Harsh Gupta 'Madhusudan',"'Madhusudan', Harsh Gupta","Rajeev Mantri, Sanjeev Sanyal","=""""","=""""",5,4.18,Westland,Kindle Edition,384,2020,2020,2020/12/22,2020/11/28,favorites,favorites (#10),read,"Ever so often, one picks up a book based on the promise of what it claims to offer, only to be disappointed after reading it. The analytical nature with which this exciting book is written ensures that it goes beyond what it promises to deliver. Harsh Gupta and Rajeev Mantri write a compelling book providing a comprehensive view of India's trajectory from a political, economic, social, and civilizational perspective. Being economists themselves, the authors explore India's various facets since independence and chart the way forward for the country with a unique combination of civilizational attitude and global outlook. <br/><br/>As the title suggests, the book primarily focuses on the importance of individual rights of the citizen as opposed to ""group"" based rights. Instead of doling out rights to citizens, the state's nature should presume the existence of rights and only be a protector of the same. <br/><br/>The authors define the Nehruvian worldview and how it embodies a confusion between the state and society. They elaborate on how India is not just a nation-state manufactured in 1947 but is an ancient civilization with remarkable continuity over the ages. We are exposed to the nature of the left-leaning and socialist character of the country's intellectual elite. This cabal prevented development on various fronts - be it education, liberties to citizens, religious practices of Hindus, judiciary, and media, to name a few. This aspect has been brought out lucidly. <br/><br/>The nature of secularism in India, or its lack, is another topic explored in depth. For example, minority educational institutions have large religious quotas and massive government subsidies that help them achieve a premier position. This, in turn, incentivizes conversion to minority faiths to reap these benefits, effectively resulting in state-sponsored evangelism. RTE (Right to Education Act) passed by the Congress government was the final nail in the coffin. It fundamentally goes against the right to equality and poses a high cost on small private schools just because they're not minority-run. <br/><br/>The control of Hindu religious institutions by the government is another glaring example of this. While temples suffer mismanagement, minority religious institutions are free to control their institutions, giving them a significant advantage to influence society in various ways. <br/><br/>A data-based comparison of the policies enacted by the various congress governments and the BJP governments and their actual impact helps bust many myths. One such myth is the telecommunication boom, which is usually attributed to Rajiv Gandhi and Sam Pitroda. However, as the authors explain, mobile telephony and the internet's growth trajectory indicates that the real boost to the sector came from enacting the New Telecom Policy in '99 by the Vajpayee government. This enforced separation of responsibilities and gave rise to the birth of VSNL and other service providers. <br/><br/>The book also touches upon the judiciary and the steady degeneration of the supreme court. The court infringes upon the separation of powers by pronouncing verdicts on subjects beyond its scope. It is also flawed in its interpretation of the basic structure enshrined in the constitution. As a result, the appointments to the judiciary are nepotistic in nature. It also attempts to homogenize Hinduism's inherent diversity by trying to be a judge of what constitutes an essential practice. <br/><br/>Finally, the book ends on an optimistic note. We are on the cusp of imminent change in India under Modi's new administration. The policy changes and implementations under the new regime, notably GST, agricultural reforms, opening up of FDI, barring of Triple Talaq, removal of article 370, etc., are indicators of a new India breaking free from its socialist past. India continues to emerge as a powerful force with greater influence in world affairs. <br/><br/>This book is essential for a variety of reasons. We must understand India's story for what it actually is and not what has been taught to us. The fresh perspective helps us re-think and question many assumptions we have about India. Granting social liberties to one group and religious protections to others only leads to further fissures in society. Individual rights should take prevalence over group rights, and only this will ensure a more prosperous and united India. And it is this detail that is the biggest takeaway from this excellent book.",,,1,0

Reviewing an epic comes with the obvious challenge of not being able to capture all of its glory. How does one view it? At its heart, it is a retelling of the Mahabharata, stripped of its mythological aspects. But to leave it at that would be a gross injustice. One may consider it a commentary on what Dharma is. We discover the politics, warfare, and strategy of the Vedic times. There is an exploration of a wide range of human emotions, from jealousy to ecstasy. Simply put, as the cover suggests, it is a tale of War, Peace, Love, Death, God, and Man. <br/><br/>I have read quite a few retellings of the Mahabharata, and some are narrated through the lens of one character in the epic (Bhima, Gandhari). But Parva encompasses them all! A series of flashbacks from all the epic's notable characters take the story forward, and it is done with the onset of the great war. <br/><br/>While the question of what encompasses Dharma has an undercurrent throughout the tale, all these characters' human emotions and personalities put the story in a whole new light. <br/><br/>Was it really a battle between two rival siblings, or was it the conclusion of a long struggle between two rival kingdoms - The Panchalas and the Kurus? Why was Bhishma siding with the Kauravas? Was the practice of Niyōga against Dharma? Was Arjuna really as virtuous? Were Bhima and Krishna right in claiming that following Kshatriya Dharma led to the Pandavas' eventual downfall at the dice game? How did Draupadi view her relationship with the Pandavas? The dynamics between two respected Sūtas, Vidura and Karna. The role of Sūtas as the bearers of Kshatriya men's children out of wedlock and as charioteers. The backstory of Krishna fleeing from Mathura to Dwaraka and his eventual usurping of Jarasandha. On the relationship between Krishna, Balarama, and Satyaki. On how the Nāgas (depicted as tribals) and Raksasās were viewed with disdain by the Aryan folks. It goes on and on. Every character is extolled only to be brought down the next instant, making this book so enjoyable. The myriad interwoven stories and motivations and beliefs, all coming together, make for an absolutely fascinating read.<br/><br/>The translation to English from the original in Kannada makes a few passages mundane. Some of the conversations between characters provide comic relief, which acts as a counterbalance to the overall narration's grave nature.<br/><br/>And then we come to the war itself, and what a narration it is! If for nothing else, just the names of characters and kingdoms and their alliances with the Kauravas or Pandavas alone makes one gape in awe. The war is described elaborately, along with all the difficulties accompanied - the stench of human and animal waste, the lack of grain, water, other resources, the fear of death, the tactics involved, the slow decline in the rules agreed upon, the ego battles, the corpses increasing in the battlefield and being devoured upon by vultures, dogs and jackals. It is as gruesome and grave as any real war would have been. <br/><br/>When the war comes to a close, one senses the devastation and the loss of lives on both sides. The entire Aryan lineage is decimated. Bhyrappa ends it with a long drawn passage reflecting on the ruin spread across the kingdom and beyond, with the Yadavas fighting each other unto death and the pregnant Sūta women questioning their plight to Yudhishtra.<br/><br/>That Bhyrappa is a legend is unquestionable. Reading his opus Parva makes one wonder how many more Indian classics are waiting to be discovered because they're written in a regional language.",,,1,0

I was pleased that we finally have a best-selling Indian author reviving stories of unknown/lost Indian heroes. But I also yearned for a more nuanced and gripping tale than the one I read. This is not a criticism of the author, but rather a reflection of my own expectations of stories based on Indian history.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, Suheldev checks a lot of boxes and is definitely a book that would reach a wider audience and make them sit up and notice the warriors of yore. It recounts the tale of Raja Suheldev of Shravasti, who in the 11th century won one of the most critical civilizational battles in Indian history by defeating, nay, massacring the barbaric Turkic invader Salar Maqsud and his deadly troops. <br/><br/>Amish has built his reputation in the historical fiction genre over the years, and Suheldev is probably one of his best-written books alongside the Shiva trilogy. He interleaves many themes from the past with the present and, in his typical style, provides insight into issues like the caste system, unity among Hindus, the role of women in India, etc. In some sense, it feels like a ""dumbing down"" of the many geopolitical/spiritual/economic and administrative milieu of that age, but he gets the point across efficiently. Some examples of these are the generalizations on Indian Muslims in comparison to Turkic ones, infighting among Indian kingdoms, etc.<br/><br/>The most exciting part of the book was the appearance of the famous Chola King Rajendra Chola in a pivotal role and a hint at a standalone sequel involving him. The romantic aspects didn't add any substance to the story, and, in my opinion, could have been avoided. <br/><br/>What else can I say, Amish is back! ",,,1,0

What gives this perspective credence is the evidence is based on the same triad of the Rock edicts, Ashokavadana and the Sri Lankan texts on which contemporary historians base their claim for Ashoka's ""greatness"". However, only the parts which suit their narrative have been taken into consideration, while the others which describe Ashoka's tyranny, religious zealousness and incongruencies between the edicts and the texts have been ignored.<br/><br/>Take for example the Kalinga war, and Ashoka's supposed conversion to Buddhism and his subsequent embracing of the religion to become a peace-loving king. This is a mainstream narrative which has been percolated across school textbooks in India. In reality, Ashoka had converted to Buddhism before the Kalinga war and continued to massacre and kill people who opposed Buddhism after the war. <br/><br/>Many more examples such as this are present, which leads one to believe that Ashoka wasn't even close to being the ideal ruler we assume him to be. The author also hints at why Ashoka, who was a forgotten figure for most of Indian history was revived during the British rule and subsequently as a post-Independence symbol of India, and he believes that Nehruvian-Socialism played a role in requiring an ancient link to an icon with a similar mindset.<br/><br/>The book itself is largely a collection of conclusions and inferences from other authors and independent researchers, and the author merely reiterates their point. Thus, it isn't a great standalone book but is a useful introduction and reference for people who want to learn more about Ashoka.",,,1,0

It is an inspirational book for someone like me, who aspires to be an author someday. This is because Ratnakar Sadasyula is an ordinary person like most of us, with a day job and a passion for history. He fueled his love for history by writing a blog on prominent historical figures who've become unknown due to the passage of time or been intentionally removed by Marxist historians. The blog eventually gave way to this book, which, albeit amateurish writing and editing, is still valuable for history lovers. <br/><br/>The book itself starts off from the 17th century with none other than Shivaji Maharaj and the Maratha empire. What I loved though, was it quickly moved from famous sons of Bhārat to unheard/unknown ones. Through this book, I learned about the Holkars of Indore and their incredible warrior campaigns and Ahilyabai's long reign and investment in public life and infrastructure.<br/><br/>We read of the bravery of the Ranas of Mewar and the historic fortresses they built; Of Pritilata Wadedar, Ram Prasad Bismil, and Bhagat Singh's revolt against the British. We also learn about the contributions from abroad from legends like Rash Behari Bose, Netaji, and Gurubaksh Singh Dhillon to the independence movement.<br/><br/>It was inspiring to read about the uprising by the Royal Navy, which led to the British leaving the country. He also touches upon post-independence war heroes like Major Somnath Sharma, who laid their lives down to protect Srinagar. Not to forget the 13 Kumaon and the Ahirs fought bravely in the Indo-China war of '62, despite knowing they were outnumbered.  <br/><br/>The author voices my thoughts when he mentions how we need to start bringing out the part of history, which is not well known to many. ""History is not just about kingdoms and battles, but also about building institutions, laws, and governments."" And, as the title of the book alludes, India is a place where ""History is under your feet,"" and any place could well be the site of some historical event or the other.

The Ocean of Churn, by Sanjeev Sanyal, is definitely one of them. For quite some time I’ve wanted to read a book which would give an accurate and vivid description of how civilization came to be, especially around the Indian subcontinent. Few people could tell the story in such a concise manner as has the author, as we wade through the origin of Homo Sapiens right up to the bustling cosmopolitan 21st century behemoth that the area has now become. <br/><br/>Choosing to focus on how the Indian Ocean has been “churning” civilization, is what makes this book stand out. When we read history, we focus a lot on wars and politics happening on land, and tend to overlook the vast role that the oceans play, be it exchange of ideas, maritime trade, or enabling migrations back and forth across centuries, resulting in a cocktail of culture and ecosystems and technological advancements. <br/><br/>It was fascinating to read how humanity overcame a variety of odds, ever since the ice ages and expanded in ways we can scarcely imagine. We learn how migrations out of Africa led to a variety of settlements from Iraq to Australia and India to Indonesia. We read about the rise and fall of the Harappan civilization, Alexander’s conquests which led to rise of the Mauryan empire, the golden age of the Guptas, the rise of Islam, the Turkish invasions, the southern kingdoms of Cheras, Cholas, Pandyas and Pallavas and their breadth of influence across East Asia, the reoccupation of Sri Lanka by various Tamil kings and later European colonizers, the colonization process which started with the establishment of Dutch and English trading companies and how we finally achieved Independence and helped other colonies achieve their own independence as well.<br/><br/>Throughout these eras, maritime trade is a constant theme, and has largely impacted how history was shaped in these places. It is what explains the presence of the largest religious building in the world, Angkor Wat in Cambodia, as it does of the voyages of Fa Xien and Vasco da Gama. Easily, reading about the sea faring enterprises was the best part of this book. <br/><br/>I was particularly pleased with the larger perspective that the book emphasizes throughout. People and events in history are judged by different standards, and what shaped their actions then might not be looked at kindly by people from a different era. The converse is also true. Hence, we find out that Ashoka wasn’t as “great” as we think he was, just as we learn Netaji wasn’t as “fascist” as history makes him look for joining hands with the Germans and Japanese. It was also heartening to note the role of various revolutionaries who were as much, if not more responsible for our freedom than Gandhi and Nehru were, and leaves one with a bitter taste when we realize how little we actually learn about them in contemporary history. <br/><br/>Going through so many layers of history leaves one with a sense of awe, disbelief and a certain measure of sadness over the constant pursuit of wealth and the destruction that human greed has caused, but, in spite of that, the very fact that millennia old traditions continue to survive and thrive in this subcontinent is a testament to the lesson which the author concludes with - that time devours the greatest of men and the mightiest of empires.",,,1,0

It speaks volumes about the author, Saiswaroopa Iyer's, creativity that she spun this impressive tale from that brief primary reference of Vishpala and her battle with Khela in the Rig Veda. <br/><br/>We are introduced to the life and times during the Rig-Vedic period, with three prominent cities being featured - Vrishabhavati, Ashtagani, and the forests of Naimisha, the abode of the sages. The story begins with the daughter of a soldier (Avishi) being taken away to Naimisha. At the same time, her father is murdered as General Ugra rises to take the throne at Vrishabhavati. What follows is a tale of discovery, love, deceit, and war as we traverse with Avishi across the northern plains of Jambudvip. She rises from a warrior to be the Ganapati of Ashtagani and battles the evil Khela.<br/><br/>The story is engaging, for the most part. Although fictional, we still get a sense of the lifestyle embraced in ancient times - the importance given to women, the code of conduct adopted across kingdoms, farming, and agriculture, the Gods worshipped (Mitra and Varuna), weapons, and even prosthetics. <br/><br/>However, the book overall wasn't a compelling page-turner. Some intimate scenes seemed to have been thrown in to cater to a mature audience. There were too many characters with similar-sounding names, and a few didn't add value to the plot. I also personally expected a relatable historical setting, with names, themes, and places I am familiar with, which wasn't the case.<br/><br/>Kudos to the author for bringing to light an ancient warrior in this modern retelling.",,,1,0

YouTube, books, Star Talk podcasts, a live talk, Cosmos, etc., are some of the ways I've become accustomed to his style and views on all things under the sun (pardon the pun). In spite of that, this book was a refreshing change, as perhaps for the first time, we get to see the personal, empathetic side of the man, who is exceptionally rational most of the time.<br/><br/>The book is precisely what the title suggests - a compendium of various letters written by him, in response to the multiple questions he received over the past few decades, or for a newspaper editorial. One marvels at his communication and writing skills while we also recognize how he has impacted scores of people in his role as a science educator. <br/><br/>Neil, of course, is consistent throughout in his responses - always respectful and courteous, whether it's appreciation or hate mail. He repeatedly invokes the ""cosmic perspective"" and is unapologetic of his views on religion, particularly Christianity. His deep care for the future of the country and the universe stand out, as he explains the importance of education and critical thinking for the next generation.<br/><br/>A couple of letters stood out to me -  A soldier in Iraq who scoured the night sky using his telescope after reading his book while being on duty; The couple who noticed a mistake on a plaque in AMNH and Neil's affable response; more than one concerned person asking if science and religion can co-exist, a grandma asking what that object was in the sky..  But the most touching was his recounting of the 9/11 attacks a day after the event.

Just when one thinks that we have learnt all we can, it pulls the rug from underneath our feet once again. Aditi Banerjee's retelling of the epic views the Mahabharata from Gandhari's lens and makes for an enthralling read.<br/><br/>Gandhari is not a character who comes to mind when we think of the Mahabharata's iconic characters. Hence, the author needed to set the context accurately to give a sense of her import to the tale, which she does brilliantly. Right from being chosen for the ""lesser"" king Dhritarashtra, to blindfolding herself, to getting a boon to give birth to a 100 sons, to being so protective of them that she skips her dharmic duties to finally cursing Krishna himself for orchestrating her sons' deaths, we get an in-depth understanding of her psyche (the author's interpretation).<br/><br/>Significant incidents are narrated in the background while the focus remains on Gandhari and her thoughts as the events unfold. This style was refreshing to read, and also one of the critical aspects of what makes this book click. The book is also excellent in keeping the dharmic nature of the epic intact by alluding to various practices and customs as they were at the time. However, interleaving the divine elements of Krishna with the otherwise realistic and practical narrative didn't work for me.<br/><br/>The Curse of Gandhari is another reminder of the depth and gravitas of the Mahabharata. It has stoked my interest in reading this itihāsa once again, and that, I believe, is the real victory for any book written on it.<br/>",,,1,0

He rightly attributes India missing the industrialization bus to the systematic bleeding of resources and the blocking of native innovation by the Britishers. Although it's a well-established fact now, it still gives the reader the right mental framework in thinking about the progress of India's economy in spite of such dire circumstances. <br/><br/>Second, he speaks about the inexcusable adoption of the Soviet-style command economy by Nehru and subsequent governments, which led to India missing the globalization wave. India had a GDP growth of a mere 4% for close to 40 years post Independence. In comparison,  countries with far lesser resources like Singapore and South Korea were able to progress rapidly with a GDP growth of more than 10% every year. <br/><br/>Swamy speaks of his contributions in providing the Swadeshi framework for the Chandra Shekhar government, and later the Rao government. The adoption of his ideas led India from the lows of the balance of payment crisis to consistently hitting over 7% GPD growth during the 90s.<br/><br/>We then fast forward to the present, where Swamy paints a dire picture of the state of the economy, in what he terms as a ""tailspin."" A consistent lack of investment in agriculture, mismanagement of resources, demonetization, GST,  lack of innovation, and policymakers who don't understand macroeconomics are cited as the main reasons for the current state of the economy. <br/><br/>He, however, does not consider it a point of no return. Swamy proposes various measures that can be enacted to get India back on track to over 10% GDP growth every year. A few non-obvious ones which resonated with me are the creation of new cities and the 7 postulates proposed by Deendayalji, which focus on ""Integral Humanism"" and adherence to Indian ethos. Compared to other ideologies like socialism, communism, and capitalism, which are materialistic, Integral Humanism focuses on the growth of humanity in harmony with their surroundings. <br/><br/>It is this approach that can translate our goals into actionable policies, and it requires the right vision and expertise in Economics to do that.",,,1,0

With that caveat, I'll proceed with my book review. <br/><br/>At its core, Mark Manson's book is supposed to be about hope. Except, it talks about everything else but that. Manson touches upon a wide range of subjects, from philosophy and religion to the world wars and artificial intelligence. <br/><br/>I will give him credit for the fact that he maintains consistency throughout the book - He establishes a concept and then draws various examples from real life to help us understand how things work. For instance, he talks about fake freedom and the trend towards life hacking of late, which amounts to reaping rewards of a commitment without actually committing. He argues that real freedom, on the other hand, comes from sacrifice and victory over our desires instead of endless material transactions.  <br/><br/>While Mark's style of writing and the way he puts his point across might appeal to some people, it just didn't quite sit well with me. One of the reasons was I felt he was trying to touch too many topics to provide the reader his streamlined vision. The other was the fact that he was re-hashing time tested axioms, which have been part of Eastern philosophy for millennia. Adding cuss words doesn't make one a ""new age"" philosopher. <br/><br/>While I did learn some interesting trivia, overall, large parts of the book didn't stick with me, and it was a tedious task to complete it.

These 10 short stories were originally written in Tamil by the author, and credit must go to the translator for capturing the tone and essence of the characters and the story and not losing it in translation.<br/><br/>What was beautiful about the stories was the central characters' focus on an inanimate object which takes center stage - a toilet, a well, a couple of chairs, a tumbler, and so forth. One lets out a chuckle at the effectiveness with which these are woven into the plot. That so few words can paint such a vivid picture and give depth to the characters speaks to the remarkable ability of the author.<br/><br/>The author's lived experience enhances the richness of the village and city lives depicted in these stories. I also admired his boldness in the use of words considered crass (""shit,"" for example) but are nevertheless a part of everyone's daily routines.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a book that you can complete with ease in one setting, definitely pick this one up.",,,1,0

Count Rostov, the central character of this book, is a man of varied experiences and expertise. Deemed to be an unrepentant aristocrat by a Bolshevik tribunal,  he gets orders to spend the rest of his life on house arrest at the Metropolitan Hotel in Moscow. What follows is a remarkable tale of the Count's friendships, romantic encounters, political exchanges, and his role in being a father figure to a girl who's responsibility falls upon him.<br/><br/>The beauty of historical fiction novels is you get a real sense of the life and ways of people while also being suspended in reality with the fictional characters set in those times. The Count's, and by extension, the authors' breadth of knowledge blew me away. Be it Tchaikovsky's music or the role of American films in countering the Great Depression. The detail and nuance in every sentence were extraordinary. <br/><br/>As we age with the Count, we start to appreciate not only the passage of time but the Count's growth from being a hot-headed youth seeking revenge for his sister's heartbreak, to the proud father, who wishes nothing but the best for his daughter. We laugh and cry with the Count, relishing his every move.<br/><br/>The Metropol hotel, its bartenders, the chef, and the head waiter all become recurring characters who we become familiar and fond. The exchanges between them over all things Russian is a lesson in history and prose. <br/><br/>What fate lies in store for the Count and Sofia after close to 35 years of house arrest?

Revered as one of the mightiest rivers in the Rig Veda and prayed to as Goddess Saraswathi, it has transcended generations across millennia to remain in our consciousness. In this landmark work, Michel Danino tells us the gripping tale of the origin, rise, and fall of this mighty river and its renaissance in the 21st century.<br/><br/>The book is titled ""The Lost River"" precisely because it was lost for millennia. British archaeologists stumbled upon bricks and structures which belonged to the highly sophisticated cities built by the people of the Indus Valley Civilization. This prompted a series of excavations, which led to a new understanding of our own history. <br/><br/>The author leaves no stone unturned in terms of the research he's done to present the facts in this book. Every aspect from its origin, possible reasons for its decline due to Sutlej and Yamuna being diverted, the various phases of the Harappan civilization - early, mature and post-Urban, the comparison between the Rig Veda vis-a-vis the geography of the landscape, evidence from numerous archaeological excavations, both Indian and foreign, planning of the cities and the consistency of their ratios across the region, flora and fauna.. the list goes on!<br/><br/>The Harappan lifestyle was remarkably egalitarian, unlike contemporary civilizations in Mesopotamia and Egypt. They had flourishing trade from their numerous ports. The lack of evidence of invasion from the east decimates any possibility of the Aryan Invasion Theory. He also lucidly explains the unbroken continuity from the Harappan civilization to that of the Gangetic one. Some of these examples which were fascinating to me were the kolam art forms, the seals carrying Pashupati and the bull, and the ratio of buildings that continue to this day. <br/><br/>The great mystery surrounding the Harappan and the Vedic civilization is that the former had great art, trade, and structures while the latter had a great literary tradition. While the Vedas speak of the geography, which correlates to the Harappan society, some unclear aspects require multi-disciplinary research. Only then can we conclusively answer the question of whether they were one and the same. <br/><br/>We are also presented with counterclaims on the existence of the Saraswathi river, and why they are incorrect. With detailed maps and pictures, the book makes for a vivid reimagining of the life and times of the Indus or rather Saraswathi Valley people and provides a comprehensive and analytical view into our past.  A must-read for everyone who wishes to know the true origins of the Indic civilization. ",,,1,0

It provides an expansive account from primary and secondary sources and covers the length and breadth of the country in its scope, thus providing a truly comprehensive insight into these incidents. Kudos to the author Meenakshi Jain for this mammoth effort!<br/><br/>The author challenges three dominant prevailing notions - that Hindu kings destroyed temples during their battles with each other and that Muslim kings merely followed that tradition; that the role of the deity in the past was as a political powerplay for the rule and had little to do with the common man and, that Muslim kings built their mosques on top of existing Hindu temple structures, indicating co-existence between the two. <br/><br/>The author surgically dissects each of these arguments by recounting a multitude of events and instances to the contrary.  She proves that the temples were establishments which were collectively nurtured by the society at large, with thousands of common men throwing their lives to protect, hide, and preserve them. <br/><br/>The book goes into great detail on various kings across the country who built historic and grand temples and the continuing service by conquering Hindu kings and the local populace in respecting this tradition. We get a reality check on the efforts that went into preserving these structures and of their everyday importance in the functioning of society. It gives a sense of why the memory of these events continues to live among people centuries after they happened, as for Hindus the ""sthala"" is more important than the actual object. <br/><br/>I particularly enjoyed the coverage on southern India, something which is usually not available in school history textbooks. Temples from Sharada Peetha in Kashmir, to ones in Ayodhya,  Somnath, Kashi, eastern India, and in the south from Vijayanagara to Kerala and Tamil Nadu temples and their origins are analyzed. An eye-opening book and a comprehensive look into our past.",,,1,0

Having not read a lot about South Africa or Apartheid, I found the narration riveting, funny, crazy, and touching. <br/><br/>Trevor takes us through a childhood where he deals with questions which even adults of today find difficult to reconcile - racism, domestic abuse, impacts of colonialism, religion, poverty, prison, and much more. <br/><br/>But through it all, he manages to keep his wit and enthusiasm for life alive. Trevors' mother's influence on him is tremendous as she struggles to give him all the opportunities she never had growing up. <br/><br/>He takes us through his growing up in different racial communities, his ability to fit in and at the same time be an outcast in any group, his adventures with his friends, his entrepreneurial spirit which even saves his life, his heartbreaks, and most of all his innate desire to understand life around him as he sees it. <br/><br/>Trevor himself touches upon the aspect of how little people know about life under Apartheid, and ironically, how the West takes precedence even in the worst atrocities known to man. He challenges the notion of the Holocaust being considered the biggest evil in humanity and claims that its because the Nazis documented their crime, while the rest of the world including Africa suffered equivalent, if not more but the vagueness in the magnitude of suffering makes people feel it was a lesser crime. <br/><br/>Many a time, due to language, race, or other uncertainties, we see Trevor in situations not knowing where the next meal is going to come from or what the future is going to be like. His ability to adapt, survive, and thrive in the circumstances and succeed while continuing to wonder why his fiercely independent mother refused to leave his abusive step-father makes for a fascinating read. <br/><br/>This book will make you laugh out loud and misty-eyed. I doubt there are many books which can tell the tale of growing up in Apartheid South Africa in a better way.",,,1,0

It is as far removed from what I expected out of a Bhyrappa novel, and it's another testament to his literary diversity. Saakshi weaves mythology, Vedanta, Puranas, and Gandhian principles in a tale which explores the human psyche from the depths of one's inner conscience. <br/><br/>Saakshi tells the story of an old man Parameshwarayya, who's preta (soul) finds itself in the court of  Yamadharmaraja with an opportunity to present his case himself as Yama wonders why he committed suicide for uttering a single lie in his life. What starts as an account of his reasons that led to his decision evolves into an exploratory tale where his preta listens to the voice of the different characters in his life and questions the very essence of what truth is. <br/><br/>There is violence, lust, greed, jealousy, and anger on one side and innocence, spirituality, morality, and adherence to dharma on the other, and the author composes a tale where the characters exhibit these qualities at various points during the story. Though the story drags at times, it picks pace soon after and gets increasingly intricate as the story progresses until it reaches a climax which leaves one puzzled about the objective of the story. <br/><br/>The writing style is unique, and so are the dialogues. Being a translation from the original, it does feel like the sentiments of the author are lost in translation at times, but for the most part, keeps the reader engaged. <br/><br/>Saakshi is a one-of-a-kind novel, a phrase I seem to reserve for every Bhyrappa novel I read.

But it is in an innovative format to write a book as it was easy to read a bunch of articles which tell a  story. <br/><br/>The book is divided into three sections - Indian history, Urban Dynamics in India and Economics, fields which the author is known to have interest and expertise in. All these fields are covered under the umbrella of ""Complex Adaptive Systems,"" that which involves dynamic interactions and relationships and whose individual entities do not sum up to the entire system, unlike a Newtonian system. Since there is a tendency to look at history, urban dynamics/planning and economics as a static planned system which can be entirely explained or simulated, it was refreshing to see it from this perspective. <br/><br/>As a history buff, I enjoyed reading the first part the most, in spite of it containing a few rehashes from his other books (which was the case for the other sections as well). Particularly interesting ones were on the need to have the Independence Day speech from different locations in India and the need to rewrite history books, for which the author deserves a lot of credit.<br/><br/>The articles under urban dynamics stressed on the importance to develop cities by using a framework which can adapt to changes over time and the need for institutions to be an integral part of any city/town rather than being walled away both ideologically and physically. While I agree with both these points, the repetition of the same in most of the articles was tedious.<br/><br/>Lastly, the ones under Economics were a bit abstract and esoteric, but nevertheless impactful. Looking at the world from an economic perspective makes one aware of the challenges countries face in terms of debt, maintaining fertility rate and so forth. <br/><br/>Overall, a well-organized book giving us an insight into the various aspects through which the author looks at India, and one which makes us want to create positive change in these fields.

This theme, of self-destruction, is repeated across various Hindu kingdoms throughout history, with notable exceptions, like the Vijayanagara empire, which in this case, put an end to the Madurai Sultanate.<br/><br/>The author makes a brief analysis at the end on the failure of the Hindu kingdoms to foresee threats, and also as to why this short period isn't an empire since it was a long succession of plunder, murder, brutality and fight for survival with no stable governance, nor any artistic or cultural influences. <br/><br/>It was interesting to read about the Hindu kings of this period and their spirited resistance, as it is not something we come across often in our history books.

The scholarship of Ambedkar is world renowned and, I am glad I got to experience it first hand by reading this ""hurriedly written"" book by the great man.<br/><br/>Dr.Ambedkar presents the case for and against Pakistan by exploring the options present to the two political parties of the time which were at loggerheads - The Congress headed by Gandhi and the Muslim League led by Jinnah. He explores the various facets of the problem at hand which are quite a handful - the motivations, ideologies of the different parties, the case of the Hindus for a united India, that of the Muslims for a separate nation, the alternatives to having and not having Pakistan, the geographical aspects of dividing a country etc. He explores the defense and army of the states, their allegiance in terms of conflict, the cultural elements which bind the two units together, the long history of religious conflicts between the two and so on. He also ensures he answers his critics by adding his thoughts on why the argument for Pakistan is a weak one from the Muslims.<br/><br/>One is astonished to see the clarity and objectivity with which he presents his arguments, leaving no room for sentiments nor partiality to either cause. Ambedkar's sole intent is to find a solution to the problem of Pakistan, and his verdict is clear - If the Muslim League does demand a separate country, then it must be granted to them. He enunciates the reasons and the way to achieve this partition from the viewpoint of the various factors listed above, most important of which is the fact that it will be most beneficial to both communities to have a nation which is entirely under their control and not subject to the whims of the minorities. Only such a country will be stable when it achieves freedom. <br/><br/>We also get ample examples from instances of countries which have gone through similar struggles, and how the choices of their leaders resulted in peace and war.<br/><br/>That we had such great visionaries as Ambedkar but still didn't allow his and other voices of reason take precedence and ultimately let the British divide our country, leading to an extremely messy carnage during Partition leaves one with a bitter taste in the mouth.

The usual explanation I came across was that Hindu kings of the time lacked unity and thus were easy targets to be conquered. This explanation never quite sat well with me, and thanks to doyens like Sita Ram Goel and Dr.Ram Gopal Misra, whose book he reviews in this book, I have uncovered the layers of truth buried deep under Marxist and leftist perpetrated ""history"" which we learned in our history books and which continue to dominate our media and academic circles.<br/><br/>This book is short but packs a punch with every sentence. We are given a point by point overview of the history of Arabic and Turkish invasions in India right from the death of the Prophet and how they rapidly expanded their military might throughout the Middle East swiftly but failed repeatedly at the borders of India, which then extended all the way to Afghanistan. We are given accounts of many Hindu kings who both individually and as confederacy's with other kingdoms (thus debunking the claim that they lacked unity) successfully thwarted the repeated attacks of the invaders and protected our territory. <br/><br/>Even the oft-touted invasions of Mahmud Ghazni and Muhammad Ghori were wrought with struggles and failures and loss of thousands of enemy soldiers. The very fact that the Islamic invaders converted every inch of the lands they conquered within a few short years but faced a prolonged resistance of around 600 years before they could establish a dynasty, and even then, India remains a majority Hindu country is a testament to the fighting spirit and the need to protect this civilizations strain of Sanatana Dharma, which was beyond any physical frontier they tried to protect as it encompassed an entire social, cultural and spiritual order.<br/><br/>How often have we heard of Ghazni, Ghori and Qutubuddin Aibak in comparison to Shahiyas, Chaulukyas, Chauhans, Chandelas, Maukharis, Gahadavads and so many other dynasties whose kings and soldiers put their lives at stake in order to protect our ethos? <br/><br/>The author signs off grimly by claiming that it is this rot in our civilizational awareness and self-confidence which has led to the severe dilution of India's heritage and that a spirited renaissance in all fronts with an aggressive forward policy is required in order to face the threat which the enemy state continues to pose up to this day.",,,1,1

By this I mean to say people have been using Dharma in a variety of contexts, each of which has added their own meaning to what Dharma actually means. It is not naive to suggest that Dharma cannot be translated into a single meaning in any language, and it can only be explored for its various facets.<br/><br/>By using one of the greatest epics of our times and one of the foremost authoritative texts on Dharma, the Mahabharata, as his backdrop, the author Gurucharan Das explores what Dharma means in varying contexts - through its characters and how each of them delves into Dharma at different conjectures in the story, as a comparison with 21st century events, as his own personal journey and above all as to what the epic itself claims to be Dharma.<br/><br/>The exploratory nature of this book is what I liked most about it, as it compares the epic in moral, religious, philosophical, socio-political and historical aspects to artifacts from other spheres. The nature and motivations of a Yudhishtra, or a Krishna are well analyzed in these aspects, to give the reader a holistic sense of the subtle nature of Dharma. <br/><br/>Perhaps the book doesn't feel wholly satisfactory because the author doesn't quite provide a fitting answer to the fundamental question of what Dharma actually is, but given that the epic itself leaves this question to the interpretation of the reader, one cannot assign too much blame to the author. The takeaway, for me, was to understand that Dharma is indeed subtle and its meaning is contextual and at the same time universal.<br/><br/>I also had a pet peeve that the majority of the references that the author uses to make his deductions were from Western sources, particularly Wendy Doniger, Romila Thapar, and Sheldon Pollock, who are not known for their unbiased views. On the other hand, the extensive bibliography was a treat for Mahabharata enthusiasts like me to explore more readings on this epic.",,,1,0

What's unfortunate is that the duo no longer evokes the suspense and excitement in deciphering codes and symbols while being embroiled in a race-against-time thriller to save the world from impending doom. Origin, the latest in the series, reads like a shadow of a glorious past, being annoying at times and for the most part disappointing.<br/><br/>What made the tales of Dan Brown's fictional professor of symbology at Harvard exciting was that he was thrust involuntarily into a situation where his expertise and knowledge of history, symbols and ciphers were put to task, simultaneously engaging and educating the reader. As Langdon fit the pieces of the puzzle together, so did we, and it was that process which captivated us. In Origin, there are very few symbols to speak of, and Langdon willingly engages in an adventure, both of which seem at odds with his character and feel shallow.<br/><br/>Origin has a similar plot template to the other books in the series - A ""secret"" which is capable of threatening the world religions' extinction is about to be revealed by a futurist scientist, and ""forces"" are trying their best to suppress this ""truth"" from coming out. Langdon and a good looking woman are in a race against time to help expose this truth to the world.<br/><br/>The ""reveal"", for which the author makes us wait almost for the entirety of the book, falls flat and is what made it a frustrating read. The fact that he chose a different country, a different church and a different antagonist don't cover for the abysmal climax nor the attempt to salvage it with an anti-climax.<br/><br/>Overall, I am disappointed at Origin's banality. Having personally visited many of the places mentioned in the book, but still failing to connect with the story, its message or its characters, is an indication that unless Dan Brown goes back to the drawing board, it is time to retire the charming Robert Langdon.",,,1,0

Bringing out historical events in a way one can relate to them, instead of listing them as dates on a calendar, is the best way to learn history. And Aavarana excels in that.<br/><br/>This is the first novel of SL Bhyrappa that I’m reading and I’m glad I came across his novels sooner rather than later. Aavarana is a multi-layered story which needs to be read many times to appreciate its nuances. At its core, it's a novel which emphasizes that truth must be told regardless of the consequences and the way to build a harmonious community is not by masking history but by learning from it.<br/><br/>The story traces the journey of Razia (Lakshmi) a liberal, rebellious and independent film-maker who goes against her Gandhian father to marry the person she loves and converts to Islam for formality, under the assumption that her husband is also progressive and open-minded like her. When she later discovers that isn’t the case and goes back to her father's place after his death, she discovers he had been researching on India's history. This sets Lakshmi on a quest of uncovering the true history of India and the many sacrifices and battles our ancestors have made against invaders. <br/><br/>This book can be considered a history book in many ways. I loved the fact that the author went through hundreds of primary sources to give an accurate account of various events and personalities, from Tipu Sultan to Aurangzeb, from the destruction of Kashi Vishwanath temple to the treatment of slaves in zenanas, the core tenets of Islam and the essence of Hinduism. It weaves the past and the present in a beautiful way, and we see comparisons to present day characters which are very relateable to the current “secular” climate in India. The protagonist, who writes a novel using fictional characters to paint a picture of real events was yet another genius structure by the author.<br/><br/>When I was reading about the book in Wiki, I noticed that there were a lot of criticisms on the book as being fundamentalist and divisive. That made me respect the author more because he has in fact anticipated this reaction and played it out in the book itself providing adequate responses to all of their baseless criticisms.<br/><br/>Aavarana is a delightful book and is a treat to history lovers and everyone who respects and values India’s ethos.

In that regard, Sapiens is an outstanding book as it tells the greatest historical story of them all - of our own species, Homo Sapiens, and how we came about to be what we are today.<br/><br/>Sapiens broaches a wide variety of subjects, as is expected, in telling this story - right from the formation of the universe, to the emergence of organisms, from the evolution of genus Homo to how Sapiens spread out of Africa and overtook the rest, the cognitive revolution, the behavioral patterns and societal instincts of hunter-gatherers all the way to modern humans, the agricultural revolution and its negative impacts on animals, the rise of polytheistic and monotheistic religions and empires, the usage of money, the scientific revolution and capitalism, the industrial revolution and colonialism,  right up to the present where we are threatening to break free from 4 billion years of natural selection by creating new forms of life through intelligent design, which makes one wonder, are humans going to be the Gods of the future?<br/><br/>What I liked most about the book was its ability to try and provide perspectives against the norm. Liberalism (which the book calls as the most dominant religion of our times) has made us believe that the ability to choose our actions and thoughts is the most fulfilling way to lead one's life, but we find out how this was hardly the case throughout history, and how there isn't a direct correlation between liberalism leading to a happier life. Indeed, the book makes one question if humanity has really progressed in all these millennia through various advances if we can't fundamentally answer the question that if we as humans are happier today than a medieval era peasant or a hunter-gatherer of the past.<br/><br/>Of course, it is impossible for one to come to a conclusion of why events in history were shaped the way they were, and like the author rightly points, the more one knows about history, the more difficult it is to ascertain why it took a particular course and the innumerable roads which were not taken. By giving us this perspective, the author makes us appreciate our story even more.<br/><br/>I also enjoyed other comparisons such as how communism and other ideologies could also be considered religions, of how imagined orders and decrees have helped our species collaborate on a massive scale and why the scientific revolution and capitalism effectively changed our view to believe that we can improve our status, energy resources and wealth without limits.<br/><br/>If this was a lengthy review it is because the book is so densely packed with hundreds of such questions and answers which makes one enquire everything about themselves and their purpose and position in life. Definitely a must-read for anyone who wants to have a macro view of their species' journey through time.",,,1,0

But it’s not often clear what exactly made them “superpowers” of that era. <br/><br/>Longitude, by Dava Sobel, gives us an insight into one of the important reasons, by delineating the remarkable story of John Harrison, who spent the majority of his lifetime with a single minded focus and dogged determination to solve the 400 year old problem of finding the longitude at sea. A problem which consumed the life of many a sailor and crew, and which made him and his son go through many vicissitudes as they had to overcome not only the technical challenges in creating a time keeper which would keep accurate time at sea, but also struggle against the politics and power structure at Great Britain, and the competing ideologies, until ultimately, the simplicity of “The Watch” led to its ubiquitousness.<br/><br/>Dava Sobel sets the story extremely well by giving us an overview of the history of the problem, the challenges faced, the science behind determining one’s position at sea and the various failed attempts made. It was these little tidbits which I enjoyed reading the most. <br/><br/>The great scientific minds of the time, like Newton and Halley, felt the longitude problem can only be solved by the lunar method, aka using the heavens (the sun, moon and the stars) as reliable timekeepers.<br/><br/>We are then introduced to John Harrison, a man with no educational background nor any experience with watch making, who decided to tackle the problem, no doubt spurred by the 20,000 pound reward offered by the Board of Longitude.<br/><br/>Harrison ended up making 5 different watches, named H1-H5 over the course of 50 years, along with his son. While H4 eventually turns out to be “the Watch” which solved the problem, the advancements made in the lunar method and the heavy patronage given to astronomers by the Longitude Board made it a very trying experience for the Harrisons who, till the end, never got to claim the entire prize money, and only got half of it, in spite of demonstrating their method to be the most superior in comparison to any other.<br/><br/>Harrison was considered a martyr among watchmakers, and after his death, it inspired many a watchmaker to make timepieces for the sea, thus making it scalable and marketable for many sailors to use. It is not a coincidence that this happened in the late 18th century, when European countries, especially Britain, ruled the world by navigating the oceans with precision, and thus establishing their superiority. <br/><br/>Harrison’s tale is yet another in a long list of remarkable humans who battled the odds and succeeded, changing the course of human history. Longitude is a must read not only for history enthusiasts, but anyone who’s interested in the spirit of human excellence. ",,,1,0

Although Sanjeev Sanyal has written some excellent books on India from a historical and geographical perspective, he is an economist by profession, and his first book shows us that it's his forte as well. After a brief look at how India collapsed from being the country with the largest share of GDP in the world to one of the lowest, he centers most of the book around the liberalization reforms of 1991 as the focal point and the watershed moment in independent India's history, considering it more important than 1947 itself.<br/><br/>While a lot of people are aware of the impact that liberalization has had on the Indian economy not many are aware of the causes which led to it. The author walks us through this phase commonly known as ""license raj"" and how it stifled productivity, growth and fostered an inward-looking and narrow-minded outlook among the citizens. He also rightly identifies that the socialist policies implemented during the years from '47-'91 might have been a knee-jerk reaction of distrust of the outside world due to centuries of colonization but their seeds were long sowed long ago going back a 1000 years to the time of the first invasions and settlement by Turks and Afghans, followed by Mughals. Eventually the tri-facto of Balance of Payments crisis, the Gulf War and investors pulling out funds forced India to open up the economy. In doing so, India burst free from its shackles, leaving behind a 1000 years of decline to rise again.<br/><br/>The chapters on how India grew from strength to strength in three phases since were the most enjoyable to read especially for someone like me who lived through these times. We get a sense of how everything from private airplanes to cable TV, and nuclear weapons to the advent of the internet took place.<br/><br/>Another major focus of the book is on the great Indian middle class and how they shaped and continue to shape India's progress on various fronts. We get a detailed outlook on how the middle class grew with the help of the tertiary educational institutions, on the myth of primary and secondary institutions not growing rapidly enough, how the IT services sector is powered by this white-collar middle class and exchange of ideas and thoughts on a global scale.<br/><br/>This book came out in 2008, and I can already see a lot of the predictions and assertions the author has made have played out accurately. We learn about the ""Asian model of growth"" and how countries like Japan, South Korea, Thailand and the latest entrant China have all grown rapidly due to their population demographics hitting a peak over the last 50 years, a lot faster than their European counterparts did during the Renaissance. India is poised to enter this peak in the next 20 years and has the added advantage of already having an educated middle-class and being a global player. <br/><br/>Of course, all is not rosy and we need to be primed to generate the manpower with the necessary skills and resources to steer us through this peak period. This involves changes at the policy level, a responsive and expansive judicial system and most of all to continue being open to new ideas and attitudes. The story of Kolkata's rapid decline from being a center of arts and culture to its current state is elucidated to make us aware of how even the best-equipped places may not always succeed.<br/><br/>Most of all I loved the optimism and confidence the author portrays throughout the book. India is on the cusp of being a world superpower, and it is the energy and dynamism of its working population which will enable us to fulfill our potential.",,,1,0

If there was one regret I had after reading this book, it was that I couldn’t read it in its original form. Few authors can narrate the tale of the Mahabharata with such poise and elegance, keeping the narrative true to the original Vyasa’s (Krishna Dvaipayana) poem, and the author, known as MT, deserves all the praise he has received for it.<br/><br/>As the title suggests, Bhima is the central character of the book, and the author narrates the tale from his perspective - his thoughts, his anxiety, his interactions with the others, and the trials and tribulations he goes through during different phases of his life, right from his childhood. We get acquainted with a Bhima who is forever second in line, always considered dull witted, and whose accomplishments never get their due - be it praise for his strength and valor, or reward for his deeds. He is constantly used as a tool to solve a bigger purpose, and the angst and sorrow he feels when he realizes that, but refuses to speak up or go against it, to keep up his impression of being a “blockhead” , are some of the more poignant moments  in the tale.<br/><br/>Like Yuganta, this book strips off all the divinity associated with the Mahabharata, and speaks of a tale of humans in ancient India, with very relatable human emotions - anger, greed, lust, jealousy and so forth. There’s no character who is without flaws, and that makes their stature grow. One doesn’t need to reiterate that the Mahabharata contains everything one can imagine, and MT brings out the nuances of every incident, be it big or small, in a seamless narrative. Extensive research has been done regarding the landscape, art, industry and traditions of that time, and it gives the reader an immersive experience of a glorious past.<br/><br/>The author’s imaginative prowess is in full display when he plays the “God of the gaps”, by drawing logical conclusions to how, many circumstances played out. Vyasa’s poem changes subject after a few moments of silence ; To interpret the sequence of events is indeed an onerous task, and I must say that he has done a commendable job. It ends the same way too, leaving it to the reader to interpret if Bhima has failed one last time or has finally been set free from his clutches. <br/><br/>Bhima is a one of a kind book, and a treasure of the Indian literary tradition, which will be rejoiced and celebrated for generations to come.

Few people can provide a narrative which is compelling and engaging, and construct a thread of events which link the people of 21st century India with their ancestors from many millennia ago, and for this, the author, Sanjeev Sanyal, deserves to be commended. <br/><br/>Having read the “Ocean of Churn” already, one notices there is quite a bit of overlap between the two books. While this book is an attempt to be “a history of India’s geography and a geography of India’s history” , it tends to be more historical than geographical. That being said, there are certain intriguing nuggets which do make the reader ponder. The fact that Indians didn’t indulge in cartography, in spite of all the ingredients necessary for a people to do so, is quite strange. As we find out, making accurate maps went a long way in establishing superiority and was one of the most important technological advancements in the last 500 years. <br/><br/>Many a times during the course of this book, we are drawn to notice the similarities in culture, tradition, and thought between present day Indians and our ancestors. While it flows naturally on most occasions, at certain points it feels interjected just to establish a link.<br/><br/>What I feel is the book’s triumph is to make the reader understand the various twists and turns in tide of the Indic civilization. The fact that 21st century India is growing to be one of the leading economies of the world, in spite of the various attacks, colonization and destruction to its body and soul, is a testimony to the resilience of the country and its people.

Nilesh Nilkanth Oak has done just that, with his rigorous and  scientific method of approach in ascertaining the date and time period of the Mahabharata war. <br/><br/>The author, like many previous Mahabharata researchers, has taken the astronomical references provided within the Mahabharata text itself, to determine this. The book reads like a research paper, focusing on various aspects - his approach and methodology, assumptions, corroboration of star and planetary movements obtained through software simulations, with the actual scriptures, dissecting various other proposals, conducting falsifiability tests, and fitting a timeline which does not ignore or explain away any of the references.<br/><br/>It becomes clear very early on that this is an extremely tedious process and requires expertise in various fields. The author does his best to give us a primer on different astronomy basics, timelines and translations of all the references he has used. Even without his conclusions and assertions, the book stands out as an excellent reference to the events which happened during the war.<br/><br/>The crux of the book, as the title suggests, is ""The Mystery of Arundathi"", which is the motion of star Arundathi ahead of Vasistha, something which wasn't explained by any other researchers so far. The author, by good fortune, diligence and with the help of technology, has proven this occurrence did indeed happen, thus giving him an upper and lower bound on the time period of the war, from which he built his case.<br/><br/>As I read the book, I had the nagging feeling that the date proposed by the author, while extremely accurate in terms of corroborating references within the text, goes against almost all of traditional scholarship in terms of civilizational development of humans. The author does address this at the end of the book, as a reason to explore our traditional methods of archaeological studies. However, that explanation seemed a bit unsatisfactory to me. <br/><br/>It was fascinating to read about the extent of detail recorded before, during and after these events, by ancient astronomers. No doubt, it has piqued my interest to learn and explore the Mahabharata further. And I feel, as stated by the author, his success lies in piquing that interest among the readers of this book.",,,1,0

SpaceX, Tesla, Solar City and the rest of his companies have been groundbreaking and pushed the limits of human capability, and we owe it to his singular capability to state the impossible and achieve it. My curiosity to learn how it all began, and what makes Musk, Musk, led me to read this excellent biography by Ashlee Vance. It is to his credit that he has uncovered a complex personality and delved deep into how his mind works, and at the same time keep the reader engaged and not feel left out.<br/><br/>We learn about Musk's unique and harsh life experiences as a kid, his photographic memory, his grasp of concepts and self learning ability and his deep rooted visions for the world and humanity inspired by science fiction and comics.<br/><br/>Musk worked odd jobs after moving to Canada from South Africa, before realizing he must tap into the dot-com boom. After obtaining a dual degree in Physics and Economics from UPenn, he kicked off his first startup Zip2, an online yellow pages website, and later followed it up with X.com, designed to be an online bank, later merged to become PayPal. <br/><br/>Musk's experience with these two companies, where he lost favor as a CEO due to investor pressure, led him to become a totalitarian in his subsequent companies. His ultimate dream was to make humans an interplanetary species, and it is with this vision that he founded SpaceX and followed up with Tesla.<br/><br/>Musk's most challenging time came during this period between 2003-10, where he spearheaded not one but two companies, both started from scratch, both looking to upset the established order, one against decades old experienced space organizations like NASA, Roscomos, etc. and other against decades old experienced car companies like Ford, General Motors etc. Electric cars and cheap rockets have been a pipe dream of many a billionaire only to see them go into oblivion. Musk went all in, faced tremendous pressure, and was within one week of going bankrupt, when Falcon 1 made history on it's fourth attempt by becoming the first privately developed launch vehicle to orbit the Earth. It resulted in a $1.6 billion contract awarded by NASA, breathing money into the company and saving both from going bankrupt. This period, more than anything, shows us how Musk is far from a normal entrepreneur. Money has never been his goal, and he is willing to risk everything to bring to life what he believes will take the human race ahead.<br/><br/>Tesla brought about it's own challenges as well, from designing a battery pack, which was secure and efficient, to obtain funding for factories to produce cars on a large scale. Wave after wave of challenges kept bombarding Musk, but he stood relentless in his pursuit of making an electric car which would be desired by the masses. Model S ended up being rated not just the best electric car, but the best car, period. <br/><br/>As it is inevitable with people of such high caliber, Musk was far from being an ideal CEO. His interpersonal relationships with his colleagues was devoid of any emotion or empathy, and he routinely discarded people who've toiled for him for years, when he felt they were no longer needed, or they weren't up to his exacting standards. Call it ego, or his psyche, Musk was intolerant to human foibles, and felt a person's life was meaningless if they didn't fully commit themselves to the task of enhancing humanity.<br/><br/>During the course of the book, Musk's demeanor and perception are often compared to that of Steve Jobs, and his astute sense of technology and it's impact to that of  Bill Gates. In hindsight, Musk seems to a unique concoction of these two, taking technology and human potential to stratospheric heights, in trying to make the world a better place to live in and inspiring millions into believing that dreams can come true.",,,1,0

Set in the background of Malgudi, The Bachelor of Arts is part two of the trilogy starting with Swami and Friends and traces the life of Chandran, and his experiences in colonial era India as a college student, who later falls in love and gets heartbroken, leading to a stint as a Sanyasi in Madras before returning to Malgudi, after realizing the sacrifices his family has made for him and how their love needs to be reciprocated. <br/><br/>If one were familiar with how “Tambrahm” uncles speak, one would notice that R K Narayan’s sentence construction is largely an English version of the same. Personally, that is what made it more enjoyable to me. There’s ample doses of the dry and sarcastic humor, and the usual fretting over the “orthodox and right way” of doing things. Chandran might seem a spoilt kid in some ways, but the decency of his approach and his thought process, his internalizations and deductions on the nature of life and his personal opinions on people and places around him are so relatable a century later, especially for someone who has been through a similar orthodox upbringing.<br/><br/>It is interesting to visualize the mindset of people who lived in the latter part of the British empire, how status was a deeply personal matter among the upper-class society, how marrying a girl above 15 years of age was seen as something negative, and how job referrals were not so different from how they are today. It was also funny to see how Madras was seen as far more cosmopolitan back in the day, and people “rude” to not even look the eye.<br/><br/>It would be silly to judge the actions of the characters in the book by today’s standards, something which we have been accustomed to of late.

And with every new interpretation, you unlock a new facet, previously undiscovered, and yearn to dive into its expanse again.<br/><br/>Set in the backdrop of Kolkata and its suburbs, Arnab Ray walks us through a series of murders from the perspective of the protagonist, Ruksana Ahmed, a senior homicide detective of the Kolkata police force. An honest politician,  an ""art"" filmmaker, a genius entrepreneur, a degenerate forensic expert and many others are introduced, as the story picks up pace with each murder being more macabre and sinister, while simultaneously revealing the underlying connection with the epic's most famous characters - Draupadi, Nakula, Sahadeva, Arjuna, Bheema, Yudhishtra and the murderer himself, Duryodhana.<br/><br/>There tends to be a fine line between an excellent mystery novel and an average one, and it heavily depends on the narration and the ability to maintain the suspense till the exposé. The author treads this line in a delightful fashion, giving us insights into the protagonist's thought process, interspersed with grim flashbacks which have shaped her and scarred her. <br/><br/>The sequence of events reach a crescendo towards the climax, and then diffuses in an admirable fashion, like boiled milk overflowing a vessel, sure to satisfy the reader in every way. That ""Aha"" moment, when you realize that the answer was staring at you all along, is what every mystery novel strives for, but few achieve it in such a nuanced and refined manner, as has this author.<br/><br/>On an aside, this book improved my vocabulary quite a bit.<br/><br/>Definitely a worthwhile read and yet another hat tip to the greatness of the Mahabharata.",,,1,0

Tharoor, in his latest book, debunks, denounces, debases and ultimately destroys this argument and the various claims to support it. <br/><br/>The grim realities of British colonialism and its effects and consequences are examined in great detail, displaying at every stage, the supremely self-serving nature of the ""elite rulers"", with little to no regard for their ""subjects"". The mere fact that the British left one of the leading economies of the world at the time they took control of the country, to one reeling in tatters, as one of the poorest, illiterate and diseased societies in the world at the time of our Independence is abhorrent enough. But to read about their systematic strangulation of every aspect of our country - be it religion, culture, wealth, natural resources, established practices and so forth, with a highly narcissistic attitude, leading to such monstrous acts, leaves one numb. <br/><br/>How, could a society which claimed to conquer and rule for the benefit of its conquered, and which held such high standards of being the torchbearer of liberalism and free speech, subjugate and humiliate countless denizens, with such rapaciousness, one wonders. The massacre of Jallianwala Bagh, the intentional starvation and death of millions in the various famines, the idea and execution of the divide between Hindus and Muslims, the introduction of a racist and biased Penal Code which has repercussions to this day, are some of the many despicable legacies of colonialism. The very psyche of Indians changed forever, with over 200 years of imperial browbeating.<br/><br/>Tharoor is a master with words, and his lucid responses (to Niall Ferguson in particular) are both cruel and delightful to read. The supposed benefits of the British ""giving"" us Railways, a ""free"" press and ""rule of the law"" are all addressed in more detail than any apologist would like to debate.  He also makes it clear that we are not passing the buck to the British on our failures as a country post-Independence, but rather to understand the wrongs of the past and how it has led to our present state. Above all, the self-respect which comes with owning up to our decisions, right or wrong, was always withheld by the British, which is as grave a sin as any.<br/><br/>That India has come out of such barbaric times to rise up as one of the largest economies in the world is a credit to its strong leaders and citizens' indomitable spirit. It would do a great disservice to the lost lives of countless freedom fighters and victims of the colonial era, if we were to ascribe our successes as a hat tip to their legacy.<br/><br/>A must read for every Indian.",,,1,0

It presents a realistic take on the events of the Mahabharata and explores the main characters in depth, as humans, stripping them of their divinity. What made it compelling was the concise, no-nonsense narration, the evidence which backed the author's interpretation, and the logical conclusion one can derive from these events.<br/><br/>The author essentially splits the story into two parts - the harsh, realism of the original text and the soft, mellowed down and effusive nature of the text with later interpolations and incongruencies, after analyzing the critical edition of the Mahabharata (which is the earliest available script in existence) leading to the exalted status of many of the characters, including Krishna, as a God and culminating in the bhakti tradition which is now widely prevalent.<br/><br/>The book reaffirmed a lot of truths I have been cognizant of late - of Karna's cowardly and selfish nature, of Yudhishtra being the real hero of the epic, of the euphemisms and alternate stories involving God's <br/>to explain copulation, and so forth. But it also described a lot of events I wasn't aware of before - of how Dhritarashtra and Gandhari met their eventual end, of Draupadi's question to Yudhishtra in the face of being stripped in public, of Asvatthama's reluctance to adhere to his dharma, to name a few.<br/><br/>A lot of the later interpolation is attributed to Brahmans, starting with the Brighu clan. The author deduces that the Brahmans became the bearers of the Mahabharata from the original ""Sutas"", and Vyasa and his followers, compiled them by including stories of their own clan. These explain the crude and out of context stories like those of Parashuram, the burning of Indraprastha on Agni's request, etc.<br/><br/>It questions the fundamental nature of questioning prevalent in the vedic times, and the lack of it since then. It portrays the fragile nature of humanity, and how it is impossible for humans to display extreme and idealistic notions and virtues, as portrayed in the later editions. <br/><br/>The author mentions in the preface that this book is her way of making the younger generation agree with her point of view and that she shall consider it a victory if they think her interpretation is wrong and read the Mahabharata just to prove so. While I do not completely agree with all her conclusions, especially those skeptical on the divine, it has indeed further piqued my interest in continuing my pursuit of the knowledge of the Vedas and delving further into the ever-inspiring and deeply profound well of enlightenment that the Mahabharata is. <br/>",,,1,0

Right from Caesar's cipher to quantum cryptography, the book traces how encryption and decryption has evolved in the last two millennia, which, by itself is fascinating. <br/><br/>Second, it can be looked at as a history book. Not many of us may be aware of how cryptography has shaped world history, and it might come as a shock to know some of the key moments in countless wars were decided by the strength or weakness of a particular cipher.

It was fascinating to learn how the two greatest pioneers of technology shaped the course of computers, software and hardware for decades to come, and how they were successful in their own approaches. The great debate of ""open vs closed"" systems, was in essence Steve Jobs vs Bill Gates.<br/><br/>There is also the highly temperamental, highly selfish, and highly arrogant nature of Jobs, which has been put into context by Walter Isaacson. He does not care about his friends, claims other's idea's as his, and makes unfair judgement on everyone. While that diminished my respect for the man, it shows how no one's perfect and also what it takes to build a company which would stand the test of time, and how brutal  and harsh life can be. Jobs never lets emotions stand in his way, he, in fact, goes the opposite way, by hurting people close to him in the most damaging way one can fathom, in order to make them realize their potential. His ""reality distortion field"", is one which is emphasized throughout, and while it's hard to believe it worked, the results proved otherwise.<br/><br/>Jobs is also not a model father, husband, son or brother, but very few people close to him, hated him for what he was. He was loved and respected by his family and colleagues, who knew how to stand up to his binary view of the world, and at the same time not alienate themselves.<br/><br/>As one reads about his thoughts as he approached his last days, as to what he wanted his legacy to be - that of building a company which stood the test of time,to make magical products resulting out of integrated hardware and software, to prioritize on product development driving profits rather than vice versa and contributing to the never-ending legacy of Silicon Valley, we realize he has achieved exactly that, in his relatively short lifespan.<br/><br/>Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson is a must read for anyone interested in technology, and interested in learning how the industry has become what it has today.

The Harry Potter series has always been in this category for me and millions more. Reaffirming this status is the latest offering from J.K Rowling set in the magical world of Harry Potter - Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, as I completed the book in one sitting.<br/><br/>Revisiting the wizarding world after close to ten years, was refreshing and exciting and most of all nostalgic. Being the original rehearsal script for the play having the same name, it does not read as a conventional book, but rather as a series of scenes to be played on stage. Continuing from where we left off at the end of Deathly Hallows, we are introduced to a world where Harry and gang are trying their best to be responsible parents while their sons and daughters try and live up to the weight of expectations set by them.<br/><br/>The book is mostly centered around Harry's middle son Albus Severus, and his (surprisingly) best friend Scorpius Malfoy and their attempts at recreating the past in order to right the wrongs done by Harry. It, however, leads to disastrous and unexpected consequences putting at risk the entire future of the wizarding world. How they set things right forms the rest of the plot.<br/><br/>While it felt bizarre and a bit rushed at the beginning, the story does do justice to the character evolutions, and gives a hat tip to most of the favorites from the series - right from Albus Dumbledore to Rubeus Hagrid. It also gives a sneak peak into a lot of moments which were left to the imagination of the reader in the books - for instance, the part where we get the viewpoint of an audience at the Triwizard tournament, rather than Harry's own anxieties. Such nuggets make the reader yearn for more, making us realize what we've missed the last few years.<br/><br/>The book provides plenty of fodder for fan-made theories and discussions. It also serves as a reflection of how quickly time flies, both in the real and the wizarding world. A mini adventure is how I'd classify this book. Certainly not an instant classic, but definitely worth it's weight in gold for Potterheads around the globe.<br/>",,,1,0

As with Jaya, I liked the snippets after each chapter, highlighting historical events and their connect with the story. Looking at the tale of Rama through Sita's eyes provides a new perspective for all readers. Reading about the not-so-familiar and generally ignored ""Uttara Ramayana"" (after Rama's coronation as King of Ayodhya) was one more engaging aspect. A good read, but not a ""must read"".",,,1,0

Set in the era of the Buddha (referred to as Gotama), it details the myriad experiences of Siddhartha, who feels discontent with what he observes around him and decides to experience the knowledge of the Atman, or Self. <br/><br/>As a young man, he realizes that one cannot learn about the Atman from any teacher, and one has to discover for themselves, it's true meaning. After hearing of Gotama, he visits him, and although he realizes he has conquered his Self, he explains to him why he cannot be one of his followers, and goes forth in his quest.<br/><br/>Siddhartha embraces different lifestyles, that of a Samana, who learns to think, wait and fast, of a Samsara, where he abandons his austere lifestyle and learns about love and what he considers are frailties of everyday humans, he dabbles in making money through playing dice, learns the trade of a merchant, tries to bridge the gap between himself and others whose capability to love he envies.<br/><br/>He reaches a point where he feels suffocated by it all, and realizes in agony how he is as far as he ever was in discovering the meaning of the Atman. As he returns to the river where he began his journey, and decides to drown himself, a sudden inner awakening with the word ""Om"", jostles him back to his senses. He feels liberated and it is then that he gets acquainted with the ferryman Vasudeva, with whom he spends the remainder of his life.<br/><br/>How Siddhartha learns from the ""voices of the river"" and Vasudeva, about what it means to discover oneself forms the remainder of the story. <br/><br/>Herman Hesse renders the tale by repeatedly reinforcing what Siddhartha learns at various turns of his life, enabling us to also understand the core of discovering the Atman - that all of life, both good and evil, needs to be accepted and loved instead of comparing it with an imaginary world where one experiences Nirvana or soulful bliss. <br/><br/>Siddhartha is one of those books which everyone should read at one point of time, and that which helps them take a step back and put their lives in perspective.",,,1,0

Ltd,Paperback,349,2010,2010,2015/05/06,2015/04/13,,,read,"While I've consumed the Mahabharatha in many forms - stories from my grandmother, B.R.Chopra's epic on TV, Amar Chitra Katha tales, etc. I've never read an actual detailed retelling of the story, from its very roots. Jaya, was my first, and I'm glad it was, considering how the author has weaved the well known plot in a manner which engages you and makes you appreciate with awestruck wonder, this compelling epic. The snippets after every chapter, gives a profound explanation of the practices and the reasons behind them during vedic times, and also many interesting stats and lesser known stories. The book gives an unprejudiced version of the tale, leaving the reader contemplate on the actions of various characters appearing in the story and the events which unfold. For stats enthusiasts like me, this book is a dream come true, as it helps you connect situations with real-life places and evidence, giving a sense of the grandeur of the poem. <br/><br/>If the Ramayana is about good over evil, the Mahabharata is all about moral ambiguity and that gray area in between good and evil. What is right and what is wrong often comes up for debate, but, ultimately, God, in his avatar as Krishna on earth, establishes Dharma and the path to Dharma. It is also clear that it is a work in progress, and many a times we will falter, adding to our Karma. And the only way to escape the cycle of life and death and reach Vaikunta, above Swarga, is to let go of all attachment and discover the truth about oneself and conquering oneself.<br/><br/>While it is impossible to touch on every aspect, Devdutt Pattanaik has done a concise job of drawing parallels between the story and the real world, aided by handy illustrations. The Bagavad Gita's essence has been captured well. <br/><br/>Overall, this book is a must read for anyone keen on reading the Mahabharata, as well as those who have read other versions, it has a lot to offer to the reader, and makes it an enjoyable experience.

23150337,Playing It My Way: My Autobiography,Sachin Tendulkar,"Tendulkar, Sachin",Boria Majumdar,"=""""","=""""",3,3.94,Hachette,Hardcover,486,2014,2014,2015/04/01,2015/02/26,,,read,"Sachin's autobiography was one book I had a lot of expectations on, as an avid fan and book reader. While the fan in me was delighted to read about his exploits on and off the field, the book reader in me was a tad disappointed, because the narration made it seem like a summary of his professional career, from Sachin's perspective. However, given the length of his career and the number of important moments in them, I feel the book has done a good job overall, in being honest and keeping the reader interested till the very end.<br/><br/>Sachin recounts his experiences, right from his childhood, to playing for Mumbai and then for India and the highs and lows he faced while playing for the country, in a way that only he can, calm and composed, and never too excited in his narration. While I was sometimes surprised by his innocence and humility, and his various indulgences, I also realised how this man, with the hopes and expectations of a billion people, strived to be not only an honest sportsman devoted to his game and country, but also be a good human being who respected his parents, siblings, family, friends and everyone else who has stood by him. His pangs at not being there for his family, and the hurt he felt when India lost or when people doubted his commitment, shows how deeply he cared for both.<br/><br/>It was joyous to read about the emotions Sachin went through, after reaching his first century, the famous 241 at Sydney, and also some tough moments like his injuries or how he felt after the 194 declaration in Multan. But such revealing incidents were few and far between, and left the reader craving for more.<br/><br/>The best feeling for anyone reading this book would be when we realise how we have grown along with Sachin, and reminisce what we were upto, when Sachin was plundering bowlers at different stages of his career. Be it the 1996 semifinal world cup loss, or the sandstorm innings at Sharjah, to the 2003 world cup final defeat, to Sachin crossing Brian Lara's record for test runs, the ""Superman from India"" moment when he reaches his 200, the world cup victory lap, and finally, to his last test innings of 74 vs West Indies. These are memories which, will not only stay with Sachin, but also the countless number of Indians who have grown up along with him, and that, I feel is why this book will be cherished by any Indian cricket fan. <br/><br/>",,,1,0
