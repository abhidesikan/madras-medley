**The Story**

We are back to our exploration of Divya Desams in Bhārat. Although I visited these temples last July, I got time to pen down the experience only now, so I apologize if I missed out on some details. For those who aren't familiar with this series, I highly recommend you read [part 1](https://madrasmedley.com/divya-desams/quest-108-1/) and [part 2](https://madrasmedley.com/divya-desams/quest-108-2/) to get an idea.

I visited 2 temples, both in and around Chennai. Getting to these temples is straightforward and there are plenty of pubic transport options available. I also visited Thiruvallikeni, Sri Pārthasarathy Perumāl Temple, but since that is very close to my heart, very historical, and one I've visited a million times, I will write about it in a subsequent post. Including these three brings my tally of Divya Desams to 30.

**The Temples**

Since we are back to Thondai Nādu, most of the temples in this area were also built by the Pallavās. There were also some later additions by the Thanjavūr Nāyaks, who ruled the Thanjavūr principality in the 16th and 17th centuries.


***1. Thiruevvul - Sri Veerarāghava Perumāl Temple***

Our first stop was at Thiruvallur, at Sri Veerarāghava Perumāl temple. The first thing I noticed was the instantly recognizable saffron-colored bus standing outside the temple, that of Ahobila Mutt. I quickly gathered that this temple was administered by Ahobila Mutt and to our good fortune the present (46th Azhagiyasingar) was on the premises. We got his blessings and entered the temple.

The temple itself was huge and beautiful. The main deity was Nārayana in his anantha sayanam, with the unique aspects being his right hand resting on top of Salihotramuni, who, as the legend goes, was an ardent devotee of Vishnu and used to feed half of the rice he cooks to seekers.

When the Lord appears before him as an old man seeking refuge asking where he should reside (evvul? in Tamil), he offers his food and provides shelter (ivvul) and thus the name Thiruevvul. He also wears a checked blanket which was offered by Salihotramuni. We also notice Brahma behind Vishnu's left hand, originating from His navel.  Other legends of the temple include Sivā getting vimochanā (rids himself of his sin of directing to kill Dakshā).

The temple premises houses a shrine for Vedanta Desikā and Āndāl among others. The pushkarani (tank) was expansive and at the same time calming. So was the delightful prasāda!

***2. Thirunindravur - Sri Bhaktavatsala Perumāl Temple***

From here we proceeded to Thirunindravur, to visit Bhaktavatsala Perumāl temple. "Nindra" means to stand in Tamil and "oor/vur" is town, and this temple is so named for the Thaayar (goddess) who, as the legend goes, had a tiff with Samudrarajan (god of the oceans) and stands her ground here. She is also known as "ennai petra thayār", indicating her forgiveness to Samudrarajan.

A unique tradition in this temple is the thayār doesn't come out during utsavams (festival) as she's considered a "padi thaanda patni" (one who doesn't cross the doorway). The main deity here has "Mām ekam saranam vraja" on his palms, which means - I am your only refuge.

This temple is around 1500 years old, which as always was fascinating to me. Nearby was a Hanumān shrine and a temple dedicated to Sri Rāma called as "Erikātha Rāmar".

"Eri" means lake and "kātha" means to protect, and since this temple is situated on the banks of the Thirunindravūr lake, it was named so. The legend goes that once the town was in imminent danger of flooding due to rains when Sri Rāma protected the people by building a wall of arrows. Also present is a unique Hanumān mūrti, carrying Rāma and Lakshmana on his shoulders.

I will soon post about a couple of Divya Desam's I visited in the north of India.
