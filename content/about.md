Namaste! 

Welcome to my website. My name is Abhishek Desikan, and I am from Chennai, India. I work for Amazon as a Senior Software Engineer (full-stack), and I currently live in Seattle, WA.  

I've loved reading and writing since I was young. Over the years, I have published many articles on different platforms, like Facebook Notes, [Blogspot](https://madrasmedley.blogspot.com/), [Medium](https://abhidesi.medium.com/9-to-5-brand-building-and-immortality-f79df9bf91ae), [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/33284960-abhishek?ref=nav_mybooks&shelf=read), etc. I've also written a few articles for sports websites and Indic ones like Indica Today. 

Being a stickler for organization, I felt the need to collate all these writings in one spot, which gave birth to this website.

Why Madras Medley? It was the name I came up with for my blog a few years ago. I have a lot of fondness for my city Chennai, where I grew up, known as Madras back then. And I dabble in many things which interest me, and hence this site is a "medley" of my thoughts!

I hope you enjoy my points of view and am looking forward to connecting with my readers.
