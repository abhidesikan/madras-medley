Another interesting retelling from Devdutt Pattanaik, this time on the Ramayana. As with Jaya, I liked the snippets after each chapter, highlighting historical events and their connect with the story. Looking at the tale of Rama through Sita's eyes provides a new perspective for all readers. Reading about the not-so-familiar and generally ignored "Uttara Ramayana" (after Rama's coronation as King of Ayodhya) was one more engaging aspect. A good read, but not a "must read".
