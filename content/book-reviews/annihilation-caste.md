Annihilation of Caste is a publication of the undelivered speech written in 1936 by B.R Ambedkar for the Jat-Pat Todak Mandal. The Jat-Pat Todak Mandal initially invited Ambedkar to deliver a lecture on the Caste System's ills. They later withdrew their invitation as they found the content of the speech objectionable. Ambedkar went ahead and published his speech on his own. It is considered one of his landmark speeches. It raises many pertinent questions on the caste system as it prevailed and the need for reform within the Hindu religion.

The book's overarching argument is that we need societal freedom before we achieve political and economic freedom, primarily from the caste system's shackles. Ambedkar outlines the prevailing discrimination based on the caste system by citing various examples. He argues how control of one man over the other is flawed. "The caste system is not merely a division of labor but also a division of laborers," he says. He mentions that caste's intrinsic nature prevents Hindus from being united beyond their respective caste groups and inhibits solidarity. He explores varna and castes and elaborates how the chaturvarna system is not better than the thousands of castes. It is still fundamentally based on the same division. He explains how an ideal society can be determined by how free are the interplays between various associations in the community.

Ambedkar delves further into the caste system's firm belief among Hindus and determines the Shastras' sanctity as the primary reason. He says Hindus should discard the Shastras and deny their authority to escape the caste system. He emphasizes the need for Hindus to examine their religion and consider what they must conserve and transmit to future generations. He also criticizes the foundations, claiming there is nothing Sanatan or eternal about it. That revolution and change is the law of life.

In the appendix of the book, Mahatma Gandhi's response to his speech and Ambedkar's point by point rebuttal of Gandhi's response is included. This also makes for a very insightful commentary.

Ambedkar's books are always fascinating to read, primarily because of his erudite scholarship and how he presents his arguments. Although I felt that the book is an adequate resource to understand caste's societal implications, it doesn't hold ground as a reference for the caste system/ Hinduism. Ambedkar's understanding of Hinduism as a religion, its foundational texts, and its essence was lacking. Hindus and Hindu society have been continuously undergone reforms both constitutionally and morally since the speech was delivered. Ultimately, it serves as a reminder of how far along we've come on untouchability and discrimination and how much further we need to go.
