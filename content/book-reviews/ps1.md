Ponniyin Selvan needs no introduction, and I consider it my good fortune to be born a Tamil and to have access to this literary masterpiece which has been celebrated for decades. While I still couldn't read the book in Tamil, owing to my language gaps, I managed to read an excellent translation by Pavithra Srinivasan. Translating a text of this scale and grandeur takes work. Still, the author did a fantastic job bringing about Kalki's vivid descriptions of the life and times of 10th-century Chozha Nadu alive.

The story itself is a classic and one we've been accustomed to since the times of the Mahabharata. An ailing emperor is at the mercy of his trusted advisors. Although his eldest son has been earmarked as the crown prince, there are conspirators within the Chozha kingdom who want to upset the established order and place one of their own, the king's nephew, as the crown prince. The ailing emperor in question here is Sundara Chozar, his son Aditha Karikalar the crown prince, and the conspirators, the Pazhuvettarayar brothers, and their associates. The title character is the brother of the crown prince, Arunmozhi Varman, who we today celebrate as Rajaraja Choza I. He appears sparingly in this first book. 

The beauty of any historical fiction novel is the ability to connect real and lived people and places with a fictitious and often riveting story. While most of the story is narrated from the perspective of the warrior Vanthiyathevan, we also get to see others' views, so it is not strictly a linear narrative. Here, Kalki excels as he transports the reader back in time and place. 

Kalki also gives an excellent overview of the history of Chozhas, Pandiyas, and others, the battles they fought, and the structures they built. We also get a deep understanding of the nature of religion, society, festivals, art, and geography of the time. 

Book 1 primarily introduces the key characters, the plot to usurp the Chozha kingdom, and the various thrilling adventures of Vanthiyathevan and Azhwarkaddiyan Nambi, the staunch Vaishnavite priest. We slowly discover the true nature of central characters like Nandini and Kundhavai. The book concludes with Parthibendran Pallavan listening to Aditha Karikalan's tumultuous love affair with Nandini. 

Onwards to book 2!
