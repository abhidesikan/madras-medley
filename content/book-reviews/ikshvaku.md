Not too impressed with the first book of the Ram Chandra Series, primarily because the writing style is exactly the same as that of the Shiva trilogy. While one might argue that it was successful, I felt it didn’t make the narrative interesting enough. I also felt the need to “humanize” all aspects of Lord Ram and the subtle but not-so-subtle analogies of present day events in India to that of a 5000 year old civilization felt flat. Overall, an average read, strictly for people who want to keep up with Amish’s work.
