In spite of a sample size of just one astrophysics book read so far, I'd like to rate this book as a very good introduction to the nature of the universe we live in, and our pursuit in discovering it's msyteries. Neil deGrasse Tyson explains in easy-to-understand language, how and why we came to be - right from the Big Bang, to the nature of elements, from dark matter and dark energy to supernovas and pulsars , from general relativity and the electromagnetic spectrum to our most recent discoveries of exoplanets. It was refreshing to revisit various high school subjects through the lens of Astrophysics. The book does just enough to answer the most basic questions one would have about the cosmos, and at the same time pique the reader's interest to delve deeper. And that, I believe, is the book and the author's most splendid achievement.
