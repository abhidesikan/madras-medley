Mr. Sampath is probably not one of R.K.Narayan's most-loved books. This is because one doesn't connect with the characters, the plot, or the setting it is in, even though it is in the familiar fictional world of Malgudi. However, it does have a few highlights, which made it an interesting read.

For one, the titular character Sampath is introduced through the lens of another character named Srinivas. Sampath is the editor Srinivas stumbles upon to help print his journal 'The Banner' and pulls through various obstacles to keep the journal afloat. Srinivas's thoughts and echoes form the reader's perspective throughout the book, not Sampath's.

We trace the camaraderie between them, their families' backgrounds, their meetings, and eventually 'The Banner' being shut down due to unforeseen circumstances. While Srinivas is lost on how to revive his journal, Sampath pivots to the grand vision of setting up a studio and directing a film. How Sampath's character slowly unravels over time and how Srinivas realizes truths about the way of life make up the rest of the story.

There are familiar character sketches, as always. We have an old man set in his ways, a friend of Srinivas lost in thoughts of a dame he saw many years ago, a wife annoyed with her husband's lack of attention, and their kid who's oblivious to the family's distresses. But while they all individually have depth, the story itself lacks it. And, of course, Narayan's inimitable English writing style shines through regardless.

Narayan touches upon aspects of the early post-Independence era very pleasingly, and one does get enchanted by the life and times of people then. He also showcases the caste system, religion, dynamics of relationships, and even mental health through his characters. The simplicity and calmness with which they express themselves do make one thoughtful.
