While I've consumed the Mahabharatha in many forms - stories from my grandmother, B.R.Chopra's epic on TV, Amar Chitra Katha tales, etc. I've never read an actual detailed retelling of the story, from its very roots. Jaya, was my first, and I'm glad it was, considering how the author has weaved the well known plot in a manner which engages you and makes you appreciate with awestruck wonder, this compelling epic. The snippets after every chapter, gives a profound explanation of the practices and the reasons behind them during vedic times, and also many interesting stats and lesser known stories. The book gives an unprejudiced version of the tale, leaving the reader contemplate on the actions of various characters appearing in the story and the events which unfold. For stats enthusiasts like me, this book is a dream come true, as it helps you connect situations with real-life places and evidence, giving a sense of the grandeur of the poem.

If the Ramayana is about good over evil, the Mahabharata is all about moral ambiguity and that gray area in between good and evil. What is right and what is wrong often comes up for debate, but, ultimately, God, in his avatar as Krishna on earth, establishes Dharma and the path to Dharma. It is also clear that it is a work in progress, and many a times we will falter, adding to our Karma. And the only way to escape the cycle of life and death and reach Vaikunta, above Swarga, is to let go of all attachment and discover the truth about oneself and conquering oneself.

While it is impossible to touch on every aspect, Devdutt Pattanaik has done a concise job of drawing parallels between the story and the real world, aided by handy illustrations. The Bagavad Gita's essence has been captured well.

Overall, this book is a must read for anyone keen on reading the Mahabharata, as well as those who have read other versions, it has a lot to offer to the reader, and makes it an enjoyable experience.
