The Sangh and Swaraj is a short book on the role of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) in India's freedom struggle. It is authored by Ratan Sharda, a longtime RSS activist who has also written other books on RSS and demystified it for the general public. This book, in particular, shares documentary and anecdotal evidence of RSS's role in the freedom movement, which has often been questioned in Indian mainstream media and used as a brickbat against the Sangh. It is tragic that a selfless volunteer organization like RSS, which has always put the nation first and hasn't sought publicity for its contributions, has to prove itself. On the other hand, the necessity to set the record straight has brought out the need for this and other books, thus enhancing the literature on the subject. 

The book briefly introduces the founder of RSS, Dr.Hedgewar (also known as Doctorji), his time with Congress, the founding of RSS with the goal of national freedom and youth to serve the nation, and its subsequent expansion. We also read about Shri Golwalkar (also known as Guruji), who took the mantle after Hedgewar's passing and was key to expanding the base of RSS throughout the country and making it one of the most critical organizations in the country. 

Both leaders took various initiatives during the freedom struggle movements, such as non-cooperation and Quit India. Furthermore, Sangh volunteers actively participated in the freedom struggle, with many losing their lives. At the time of independence and partition, Guruji and the Sangh were at the forefront of the crisis, being involved in relief and rehabilitation work for the countless people whose lives were uprooted. They also did exemplary work in protecting women and children from atrocities by setting up various relief camps.

Lastly, the author sheds light on the RSS's growing popularity and the resentment it caused the Congress. The Congress tried various ways to stifle the organization's growth despite stating many times that it did not have any political goals and was only focused on national service. After the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi, a ban was placed on RSS despite them strongly condemning the incident and having a nationwide mourning. Eventually, though the ban was lifted, it showed the vile machinations of the Congress of the time, and the consequences of those actions continue to tarnish the RSS's image today. 

It can be said without ambiguity that RSS played a vital role in the Indian freedom struggle, without which one cannot imagine the level of damage that could have been caused. The organization continues to be the backbone of India in times of crisis and should be celebrated and acknowledged for its contributions.
