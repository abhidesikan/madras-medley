There are only a few books which are "unputdownable". The Harry Potter series has always been in this category for me and millions more. Reaffirming this status is the latest offering from J.K Rowling set in the magical world of Harry Potter - Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, as I completed the book in one sitting.

Revisiting the wizarding world after close to ten years, was refreshing and exciting and most of all nostalgic. Being the original rehearsal script for the play having the same name, it does not read as a conventional book, but rather as a series of scenes to be played on stage. Continuing from where we left off at the end of Deathly Hallows, we are introduced to a world where Harry and gang are trying their best to be responsible parents while their sons and daughters try and live up to the weight of expectations set by them.

The book is mostly centered around Harry's middle son Albus Severus, and his (surprisingly) best friend Scorpius Malfoy and their attempts at recreating the past in order to right the wrongs done by Harry. It, however, leads to disastrous and unexpected consequences putting at risk the entire future of the wizarding world. How they set things right forms the rest of the plot.

While it felt bizarre and a bit rushed at the beginning, the story does do justice to the character evolutions, and gives a hat tip to most of the favorites from the series - right from Albus Dumbledore to Rubeus Hagrid. It also gives a sneak peak into a lot of moments which were left to the imagination of the reader in the books - for instance, the part where we get the viewpoint of an audience at the Triwizard tournament, rather than Harry's own anxieties. Such nuggets make the reader yearn for more, making us realize what we've missed the last few years.

The book provides plenty of fodder for fan-made theories and discussions. It also serves as a reflection of how quickly time flies, both in the real and the wizarding world. A mini adventure is how I'd classify this book. Certainly not an instant classic, but definitely worth it's weight in gold for Potterheads around the globe.
