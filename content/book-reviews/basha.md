Reading a third person's view on Rajinikanth is always an enjoyable experience. The fan in every Tamilian glows proudly as someone effuses praise on the Superstar's humility, punctuality, dedication and his respect for people and the art itself. On this occasion it is right from the horse's mouth, Suresh Krissna, director of his smash hit Baasha, who takes us through his experience of directing Rajni in 3 of his most memorable films - Annamalai, Veera and Baasha.

The book is an enjoyable read, for its simplistic narration, the various anecdotes and trivia we learn about Rajni on set and off it, his anxiety before film releases, the brainstorming sessions on different scenes, his transformation into the character "Maanick-Baasha" and so on. It was interesting to know Rajni wasn't merely a director's actor, but actively contributed to many scenes of his movies. It was also nostalgic, a throwback of sorts, as any 90's kid would remember the days of painted posters and limited to none publicity for movies before their release, while still enjoying stupendous success nonetheless.

A definite pick me up for every Rajni fan.
