I was fortunate to get my hands on some of Sita Ram Goel's books, one of India's eminent historians. In this book, he talks about the meaning of Secularism as it originated in the West, and how it's context has been contorted and turned on its head in India. A comparison between the pagan or Advaita philosophies, with that of monotheistic religions follows, and we get to see why secularism as it's defined in the West is, in the author's words, like "holding a lamp to the Sun", in India.

We also are given an overview of the scriptural and philosophical differences between the religions of the book, and the dharmic religions based on Santana Dharma. It makes us understand that the two are in different planes, and cannot even be compared to each other.

The book also includes a chapter on the emerging national vision for India, and how we need to get back to the ideals and goals laid down by our leaders during the Swadeshi movement, in order to emerge as the leading nation and as an exemplary example to the rest of the world.

Sita Ram Goel is unabashed in his criticism of other religions, and it comes from a deep understanding and study of their scriptures. He is scathing in his criticisms of Hindus as well, and calls out the collective failure of Hindus at various points of time in the history of India where they could have established the dharmic way of life once again.

In today's day and age, where people are instantly branded based on their religion, whether they adhere to it's values or not, and where Secularism has become an alternative term for minority appeasement, it is books like these which can help every Indian understand their place in history and reinvigorate them towards the vision set out by their forefathers.
