I don't think I've given a lower rating for any book I've read so far. I would have given it 0 stars if I could. That should, in a nutshell, explain how I felt about this book. A terribly slow and sluggish novel, with a wafer-thin plot about a manila envelope and how three women try to discover the meaning of it's contents, disguised within the authors failed attempt to make the narrative thrilling.

Right from the first page, one gets the impression that the aim of the book was to eventually make it a movie. Unnecessary descriptions, too much emphasis on the handicap of one of the central character, and purposeless chase scenes, make the book an inescapable drag.

Any book positioned as the first in a series, still needs to standout as a solitary novel. All this book does is to set things up for future novels, and by the time the "reveal" is made, it made me wish I hadn't read this book in the first place.

I think it's safe to say I won't be reading it's sequels.
