History Under Your Feet is an excellent book for reasons which are not typically why books are considered worthy of praise, at least by me. It is an inspirational book for someone like me, who aspires to be an author someday. This is because Ratnakar Sadasyula is an ordinary person like most of us, with a day job and a passion for history. He fueled his love for history by writing a blog on prominent historical figures who've become unknown due to the passage of time or been intentionally removed by Marxist historians. The blog eventually gave way to this book, which, albeit amateurish writing and editing, is still valuable for history lovers.

The book itself starts off from the 17th century with none other than Shivaji Maharaj and the Maratha empire. What I loved though, was it quickly moved from famous sons of BhƒÅrat to unheard/unknown ones. Through this book, I learned about the Holkars of Indore and their incredible warrior campaigns and Ahilyabai's long reign and investment in public life and infrastructure.

We read of the bravery of the Ranas of Mewar and the historic fortresses they built; Of Pritilata Wadedar, Ram Prasad Bismil, and Bhagat Singh's revolt against the British. We also learn about the contributions from abroad from legends like Rash Behari Bose, Netaji, and Gurubaksh Singh Dhillon to the independence movement.

It was inspiring to read about the uprising by the Royal Navy, which led to the British leaving the country. He also touches upon post-independence war heroes like Major Somnath Sharma, who laid their lives down to protect Srinagar. Not to forget the 13 Kumaon and the Ahirs fought bravely in the Indo-China war of '62, despite knowing they were outnumbered.

The author voices my thoughts when he mentions how we need to start bringing out the part of history, which is not well known to many. "History is not just about kingdoms and battles, but also about building institutions, laws, and governments." And, as the title of the book alludes, India is a place where "History is under your feet," and any place could well be the site of some historical event or the other. Do we really want to forget these stories which can educate and inspire the generations to come?
