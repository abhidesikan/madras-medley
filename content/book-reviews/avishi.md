Avishi is a fictional tale re-imagining Vishpala, a woman mentioned in the Rig-Veda. It speaks volumes about the author, Saiswaroopa Iyer's, creativity that she spun this impressive tale from that brief primary reference of Vishpala and her battle with Khela in the Rig Veda.

We are introduced to the life and times during the Rig-Vedic period, with three prominent cities being featured - Vrishabhavati, Ashtagani, and the forests of Naimisha, the abode of the sages. The story begins with the daughter of a soldier (Avishi) being taken away to Naimisha. At the same time, her father is murdered as General Ugra rises to take the throne at Vrishabhavati. What follows is a tale of discovery, love, deceit, and war as we traverse with Avishi across the northern plains of Jambudvip. She rises from a warrior to be the Ganapati of Ashtagani and battles the evil Khela.

The story is engaging, for the most part. Although fictional, we still get a sense of the lifestyle embraced in ancient times - the importance given to women, the code of conduct adopted across kingdoms, farming, and agriculture, the Gods worshipped (Mitra and Varuna), weapons, and even prosthetics.

However, the book overall wasn't a compelling page-turner. Some intimate scenes seemed to have been thrown in to cater to a mature audience. There were too many characters with similar-sounding names, and a few didn't add value to the plot. I also personally expected a relatable historical setting, with names, themes, and places I am familiar with, which wasn't the case.

Kudos to the author for bringing to light an ancient warrior in this modern retelling.
