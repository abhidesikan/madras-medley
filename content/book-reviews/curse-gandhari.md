The Mahabharata is an epic that keeps giving food for thought on every new reading. Just when one thinks that we have learnt all we can, it pulls the rug from underneath our feet once again. Aditi Banerjee's retelling of the epic views the Mahabharata from Gandhari's lens and makes for an enthralling read.

Gandhari is not a character who comes to mind when we think of the Mahabharata's iconic characters. Hence, the author needed to set the context accurately to give a sense of her import to the tale, which she does brilliantly. Right from being chosen for the "lesser" king Dhritarashtra, to blindfolding herself, to getting a boon to give birth to a 100 sons, to being so protective of them that she skips her dharmic duties to finally cursing Krishna himself for orchestrating her sons' deaths, we get an in-depth understanding of her psyche (the author's interpretation).

Significant incidents are narrated in the background while the focus remains on Gandhari and her thoughts as the events unfold. This style was refreshing to read, and also one of the critical aspects of what makes this book click. The book is also excellent in keeping the dharmic nature of the epic intact by alluding to various practices and customs as they were at the time. However, interleaving the divine elements of Krishna with the otherwise realistic and practical narrative didn't work for me.

The Curse of Gandhari is another reminder of the depth and gravitas of the Mahabharata. It has stoked my interest in reading this itihƒÅsa once again, and that, I believe, is the real victory for any book written on it.
