I have followed Neil deGrasse Tyson for a long time. YouTube, books, Star Talk podcasts, a live talk, Cosmos, etc., are some of the ways I've become accustomed to his style and views on all things under the sun (pardon the pun). In spite of that, this book was a refreshing change, as perhaps for the first time, we get to see the personal, empathetic side of the man, who is exceptionally rational most of the time.

The book is precisely what the title suggests - a compendium of various letters written by him, in response to the multiple questions he received over the past few decades, or for a newspaper editorial. One marvels at his communication and writing skills while we also recognize how he has impacted scores of people in his role as a science educator.

Neil, of course, is consistent throughout in his responses - always respectful and courteous, whether it's appreciation or hate mail. He repeatedly invokes the 'cosmic perspective' and is unapologetic of his views on religion, particularly Christianity. His deep care for the future of the country and the universe stand out, as he explains the importance of education and critical thinking for the next generation.

A couple of letters stood out to me - A soldier in Iraq who scoured the night sky using his telescope after reading his book while being on duty; The couple who noticed a mistake on a plaque in AMNH and Neil's affable response; more than one concerned person asking if science and religion can co-exist, a grandma asking what that object was in the sky.. But the most touching was his recounting of the 9/11 attacks a day after the event. That recollection was so vivid that one feels like they witnessed the tragedy live.

I wouldn't call this book a 'must-read,' but it's definitely a delightful read.
