How is our country governed? What are its various organs, tiers and aspects, and how do they impact our day-to-day life? How can we as citizens, understand public policy and play a role in shaping them to improve our standard of living? These, and many other aspects of our democracy and governance are answered in a clean and cohesive manner in this book. It aims to address the citizen who yearns to be aware of how the government machinery works for him/her, and what he/she can do to make it better.

I was impressed with the carefully structured format of the book, and the detailed explanations on a wide variety of key topics - our parliament, elections, public administration, the budget, grievance redressal etc. The importance of local body governments and it's functioning was an eye opener, as was the role of a civil society. Exercises and QR codes providing nuggets of information were an added bonus, making the reading enjoyable and engaging. There is also useful information on how we can engage in public policy and the various career opportunities in this field.

I learnt a lot from this book, and I feel it should be part of our schooling system as a textbook or as a reference book.
