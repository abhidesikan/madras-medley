Part 2, and others, are a direct continuation of their previous parts; hence, it is easy to pick up from where we left off. We spend some time in Thanjai, where we witness a battle of words and wits between the Ilaya Piratti Kundhavai and Pazhuvoor Rani Nandini, but most of the story is set in Sri Lanka. As the story progresses, we see Vandhiyathevan eventually establishing contact with Kundhavai, who assigns him the new task of bringing back her younger brother, Arunmozhi Varman, from Ilankai. His elder brother, Aditya Karikalan, also does the same, sending Parthibendran Pallavan with his message. 

The book follows a similar theme to Book 1, filled with adventure, fights, escapes, and mysteries. After a long wait, we meet the book's central character, Prince Arunmozhi Varman, a.k.a Ponniyin Selvan, as Vanthiyathevan and Azhwarkkadiyan find him in Sri Lanka. Kalki describes the islands, the flora, and the fauna exquisitely, and also the prevailing Buddhist influences there. He also elaborately details the character of Ponniyin Selvan as a humble, just, and empathetic ruler and draws a sharp contrast with his elder and rash brother Aditya Karikalan. Ponniyin Selvan respects all religions and Gods, goes to any lengths for his people and friends, never goes against his king's (and father's) wishes, and treats everyone with empathy and kindness. So good was he that the residents of Ilankai went about their business and worshipped him wherever he went, despite the Chozas warring against King Mahindan. 

We are also introduced to a few key characters, most notably Mandakini, a.k.a Oomai Rani, who acts as the guardian angel of our hero, saving him from drowning as a kid as well as various attempts by the Pandyan rebels to kill him in Sri Lanka. Moreover, she arrives with food and an Arab horse and guides the Prince during crucial times, sharing vital information. We also get to know Poonguzhali, the boat woman with such deep affection for the Prince and who journeys with him as he tries to honor his father's commands and be imprisoned by troops coming from Thanjai. And lastly, Kodumbalur Periya Velar Senathipathi Boothi Vikramakesari,  who bristles at the mention of Pazhuvettaraiyars and vows to go to any lengths to protect the king. 

Kalki portrays Arunmozhi Varman as someone who thinks of himself almost as a victim of circumstance, as he laments his fate of not having anyone who wants to know what his inner desires are - to travel and explore the world through the seas. In contrast, everyone wants to burden him with one title or the other and rule the Chola Kingdom. He emphasizes the enormous challenge of leading such a vast country, and he's glad there are others before him. It is interesting to imagine that the great Raja Raja Chozan would have felt this way, and moments like these make this book a masterpiece. 

The exchanges between Vanthiyathevan, the Prince, and Azhwarkaddiyan are timely and hilarious and make one wonder how much better it would have been in Tamil. The book ends on a cliffhanger, with Vandhiyathevan caught in the middle of a storm as the magician Ravidasan and Devaralan abandon him on board after he refuses to join their mission of destroying the Cholas. Our Prince braves it all to save him in the nick of time. Onwards to part 3!
