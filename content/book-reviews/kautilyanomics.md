Kautilyanomics by Sriram Balasubramanian is an interesting book that combines modern economics with the ancient wisdom of Kautilya, also known as Chanakya. While the Arthashastra is primarly known as a treatise on statecraft, politics and military strategy, the author explores the economic policies and vision prescribed by Chanakya in the text and draws parallels with Bharat in the 21st century and how we can draw lessons from Kautilya. 

The author first explores the research and the depth of understanding in Sanksrit as well as Bharatiya culture needed as a prerequisite to begin to understand the foundations of this treatise. 

After a brief overview of Arthashastra he then focuses on the foundation of economic policies as laid down by Chanakya. The fundamental world view of Kautilya's economic policies are its foundation in Dharma. Dharma forms the basis of creating a sustainable society with ethics, responsibilities and social harmony.

He then explores different aspects of policymaking and modern day economic functions like trade, sustainability, environment, growth, debt, wealth creation, gold, manufacturing etc. He also explores the unique nature of India as a civilization, our propsensity to save gold as a hedge and hereditary treasure, the aspect of communinty loans instead of traditional loans and how our kings acted as servants of the people rather than authoritarian regimes. 

He also tries to extrapolate how Kautilya would have dealt with uncertainities like the COVID pandemic and how Kautilya would have dealt with them as well as lessons we can learn. 

Overall, the book is a good introduction to the Arthashastra from an economic perspective and piques the reader to explore it in depth.
