Kautilyanomics by Sriram Balasubramanian is an interesting book that combines modern economics with the ancient wisdom of Kautilya, also known as Chanakya. While the Arthashastra is primarily known as a treatise on statecraft, politics, and military strategy, the author explores the economic policies and vision prescribed by Chanakya in the text and draws parallels with Bharat in the 21st century, highlighting the lessons we can learn from Kautilya.

The author first explores the depth of research and the level of understanding of Sanskrit, as well as Bharatiya culture, that are required as prerequisites to begin understanding the foundations of this treatise.

After a brief overview of the Arthashastra, he focuses on the foundations of economic policy as laid down by Chanakya. The fundamental worldview of Kautilya’s economic thought is rooted in Dharma. Dharma forms the basis for creating a sustainable society built on ethics, responsibilities, and social harmony.

He then explores different aspects of policymaking and modern-day economic functions such as trade, sustainability, the environment, growth, debt, wealth creation, gold, and manufacturing. The author also examines the unique nature of India as a civilization—our propensity to save gold as a hedge and hereditary treasure, the practice of community-based loans instead of traditional lending systems, and the way kings functioned as servants of the people rather than as authoritarian rulers.

He further attempts to extrapolate how Kautilya might have dealt with uncertainties such as the COVID pandemic and the lessons we can draw from such an approach.

Overall, the book serves as a good introduction to the Arthashastra from an economic perspective and piques the reader’s interest to explore the text in greater depth.
