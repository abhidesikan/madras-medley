Since its inception, the Aryan Invasion Theory (AIT) has taken various twists and turns and has been responsible for debates in multiple spheres like academia, literature, etc. Owing to India's unique history, unlike other countries, there have been intense political disputes and consequences with deep-rooted ramifications due to the AIT. Our history books still teach AIT as the primary theory of how we acquired our languages and culture. Few people are even aware of the alternative approach known as the Out of India Theory (OIT) and how it counters the AIT.

Traditionally the debate has been discussed on three academic disciplines: Linguistics, Archaeology, and Inscriptional data. In its latest iteration, a new field has come into play: Genetics. In this book, Shri Shrikant Talageri produces a detailed and highly critical response to a book named "Early Indians" written by Tony Joseph, who argues that the AIT has been conclusively proved due to genetic evidence uncovered in 2018.

The author does a fantastic job of meticulously dissecting every "evidence" propounded by Tony Joseph by countering it with factual data and calling out the propaganda underlying the arguments of the former. Whether it be migration patterns, genetic evidence, chronological evidence, textual evidence in the Rig Veda, geographical evidence of the rivers mentioned, and even the evidence on horses, Shri Shrikant Talageri proves how genetics has no bearing on the debate of the Homeland, i.e., the common origin of the Indo-European languages.

Throughout the book, the author decisively proves the case for OIT and uses the genetic evidence to further establish how OIT makes even more sense now, instead of the contrary.

What was gratifying about the book was the easy-to-understand manner he explains and provides context to the debate. A word of appreciation should also be given to Shri Koenraad Elst, who, in his foreword, beautifully articulates the history of this debate and its implications and the approach both sides should be taking as academics and not indulge in mudslinging.

A must-read for not just AIT/OIT enthusiasts but anyone interested in the origins of where we came from.
