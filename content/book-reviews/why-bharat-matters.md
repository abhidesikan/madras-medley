Why Bhārat matters can be considered a point-in-time book that gives a snapshot of India, its place in the world today, and its relationships and challenges in a global economy. It can also be considered a geopolitical history book that outlines our journey since independence and the vicissitudes we’ve seen with our foreign affairs. The book also establishes the vision and focus for the future and charts the path ahead. Hence, it can be seen as a foundational book for a rising India. All of this is stitched into a cohesive and engaging read by drawing historical parallels with the Ramayana, narrated by the sitting Minister of External Affairs of India, Dr.S Jaishankar, making this a very engaging read for people who believe in the India story. 

What sets this book apart is its ability to help the reader understand the nature and scope of external affairs and the scale at which the “mind games” happen. No country is too small, and no negotiation is straightforward. From the USA to China, bilateral relations to QUAD, influencing nations with soft and hard power like Vaccine Maitri, etc., Jaishankar paints the world and India’s role with a broad brush. He gives a sense of the complexities and challenges involved. 

It was enlightening to read about the sharpness and clarity with which each relationship is analyzed, its historical precedent, and the thinking behind decision-making. Decades of efforts to build a relationship can turn sour instantly, as seen when China clashed with India at Galwan. The opposite is true as well, where relatively sparse exchanges with countries rapidly advanced after renewing contact for each other’s benefit, as is the case with Australia. 

What shines through all of this is that the India pre-2014 and post-2014 under the Modi leadership are distinct from each other in many ways, and significant progress has been achieved in the last ten years than, one could argue, has been made in all of the post-independence years combined before that. And we must give credit where it’s due. It is indeed heartening and encouraging to see India in safe hands and ready to take on the leadership of the global south and put its own interests first while balancing it worth the needs of its neighbors and the world at large.
