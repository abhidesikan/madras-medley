It's not often that I'm completely bowled over by the precision in which someone puts forth an issue and presents arguments which are compelling, educational, rational and with the right historical context. The scholarship of Ambedkar is world renowned and, I am glad I got to experience it first hand by reading this "hurriedly written" book by the great man.

Dr.Ambedkar presents the case for and against Pakistan by exploring the options present to the two political parties of the time which were at loggerheads - The Congress headed by Gandhi and the Muslim League led by Jinnah. He explores the various facets of the problem at hand which are quite a handful - the motivations, ideologies of the different parties, the case of the Hindus for a united India, that of the Muslims for a separate nation, the alternatives to having and not having Pakistan, the geographical aspects of dividing a country etc. He explores the defense and army of the states, their allegiance in terms of conflict, the cultural elements which bind the two units together, the long history of religious conflicts between the two and so on. He also ensures he answers his critics by adding his thoughts on why the argument for Pakistan is a weak one from the Muslims.

One is astonished to see the clarity and objectivity with which he presents his arguments, leaving no room for sentiments nor partiality to either cause. Ambedkar's sole intent is to find a solution to the problem of Pakistan, and his verdict is clear - If the Muslim League does demand a separate country, then it must be granted to them. He enunciates the reasons and the way to achieve this partition from the viewpoint of the various factors listed above, most important of which is the fact that it will be most beneficial to both communities to have a nation which is entirely under their control and not subject to the whims of the minorities. Only such a country will be stable when it achieves freedom.

We also get ample examples from instances of countries which have gone through similar struggles, and how the choices of their leaders resulted in peace and war.

That we had such great visionaries as Ambedkar but still didn't allow his and other voices of reason take precedence and ultimately let the British divide our country, leading to an extremely messy carnage during Partition leaves one with a bitter taste in the mouth. A must-read book to understand the political climate before and during partition.
