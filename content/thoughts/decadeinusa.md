10 years ago, on August 9, 2013, I first stepped into the USA. As a 23-year-old, I came here for my Master's degree, and my plan was to graduate, hopefully, get a job, repay my education loan, and return to Chennai within 2 years. Clearly, fate had other plans, and cliched as it might sound, I can't believe it's 10 years already. 

Some stats: In my time here, I've been to 25 states, lived in 4 cities, worked for 3 tech companies, driven 10s of thousands of miles, explored a handful of National parks, visited 3 other countries, been to countless sporting events and 0 Taylor Swift concerts. Whether watching Stone Cold Steve Austin in Wrestlemania or witnessing Rafael Nadal win a grand slam, I've been fortunate to have experienced so many moments I only dreamt of growing up.

That paints a rosy picture, and the journey has been fantastic touchwood. However, immigrant life is not without its challenges. It forces you to be self-sufficient - you learn everything from cooking, managing your finances, and cleaning your toilet. It forces you to keep updating your skills, and even if you do, you're only one layoff away from losing your job, which is stressful. Being far from family and missing important events and festivities is frustrating. It makes you adapt to being alone and combating loneliness. Pushing through these phases has taught me many valuable lessons. 

I don't know what the future holds for me and where I'll be ten years from now, but I will always cherish the fact that I lived and continue to live some of the best years of my life in this country, and no one can take that away from me. I have made some lifelong friendships and learned from some incredible people. That I get to share all this with my wife now makes it even more special for me. 

India is where I was born and raised and is my home. But America is where I truly came into my own. A thousand things may need to be fixed here; nevertheless, I am incredibly grateful to this land of opportunities and the people who've shaped my experiences. Vaazhga valamudan America!
